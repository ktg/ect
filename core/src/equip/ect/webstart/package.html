Java WebStart support classes the EQUIP Component Toolkit.
<h2>Overview</h2>
The main application is {@link ect.webstart.Boot}. This is run with no args and (if not auto-starting) creates a {@link ect.webstart.BootFrame} GUI. This allows the user to (a) re-start or re-join a previous installation (b) join a discovered installation or (c) start a new installation as master.<p>
Each known installation is represented by an {@link equip.ect.webstart.Installation} object, which each container within
an installation is represented by an {@link equip.ect.webstart.Container} object. Typically a container is a child process, e.g. a JVM running {@link equip.ect.apps.ExporterGUI} for the Java container. An installation master also runs a multicast-discoverable dataspace server.<p>
Once an installation has been (re-)started (or joined) then a {@link equip.ect.webstart.HostManager} and associated {@link equip.ect.webstart.HostManagerFrame} is created, allow management of that host in that installation. In particular, this should make visible the installation type (e.g. master) and status (e.g. active), and the configured containers and their status. It should also allow the user to re-configure, stop and re-start containers in that installation, and to terminate the installation (typically returning to the boot state). Part of the re-configuration should be to allow the addition of new component types (unless this is handled by the container itself?!).<p>

</pre>
The property files are for (in order):
<ul><li>{@link equip.ect.webstart.Boot} on this host</li>
<li>{@link equip.ect.webstart.Installation} for the cmg-office installation (mastered on this machine)</li>
<li>{@link equip.ect.webstart.Container} and {@link equip.ect.apps.ExporterGUI} Java container which is part of that installation on this host.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Self-deployment of components</h3>
On starting each Installation will check a url for an XML file specifying which components and support libraries/dlls it should download. See {@link ect.webstart.DownloadManger} for details of this file. There is a sample file in the resources directory.<p>

<h3>Notes/issues</h3>
<ul>
<li>After creating an installation it (and the (default) Java container) is auto-start, so subsequent access to BootFrame is suppressed.</li>
<li>{@link BootFrame} uses presence of a '*' in the discovered Url as necessary and sufficient evidence that it has discovered an installation (rather than e.g. a simple dataspace) - this should probably use a different service type URL aswell/instead (currently uses standard dataspace service type).</li>
<li>There is no GUI method to terminate an {@link Boot} or container/installation.</li>
<li>Stringification of shared secret to installation property file is broken.</li>
<li>java container components directory is initially empty, and there is no standard way to populate, or to add other dependent jars or DLLs to class/path.</li>
<li>Container start current hard-coded to java only (ignores properties).</li>
</ul>
