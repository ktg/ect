A multicast-based peer-to-peer discovery module, based on the design
of JINI discovery, but for discovering strings (such as dataspace
URLs).<P>

In order to advertise something use {@link
equip.discovery.DiscoveryServerAgent} (see for example {@link
equip.discovery.DataspaceServer}).<P>

In order to discover things use {@link
equip.discovery.DiscoveryClientAgent} (see for example {@link
equip.discovery.ExampleClient}).<P>

Based in part on JINI multicast discovery request. Each advert has one
or more <b>service types</b>, and one or more <b>groups</b><P>.

Service Type (which is something that is not present in JINI, since we
are not just looking for lookup services) has the common form
"&lt;interface-class-name&gt;:&lt;version-identifier&gt;".<P>

As in JINI (and SNMP), groups are strings which must match exactly
to identify common communities of action. E.g. to support
concurrently deployment of different versions of the system.<P>

Non-multicast support is provided by (a) running the 
{@link equip.discovery.DiscoveryRendezvous} intelligent (i.e. selective)
reflector, and using equip.eqconf to configure each client and server
to use it (see the 'discoveryGroup' to the IP addresss or DNS name of
the machine running the rendezvous server. Default port for the 
server is 4170. Other ports are random. <P>
