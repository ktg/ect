<h1>Using EQUIP with VPNs and other network arrangements</h1>
Chris Greenhalgh, 2005-02-07<br>
<h2>VPN...</h2>
I'll base this on what I see in windows...<br>
A VPN connection looks in the routing/IP stack like another interface
with its own IP address, etc.<br>
If EQUIP does not appear to be picking up the VPN address (check the
console output) then use the ConfigManager option:<br>
<pre>localhost: IP-OF-MACHINE-ON-VPN<br></pre>
Unfortunately, with DHCP, this may change when the machine is
restarted; sorry.<br>
Configuration information is normally read from the file <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">equip.eqconf</span> in the directory
identified by the EQUIP_PATH environment variable/Java property
(defaults to the current working directory). Note that this is only
read when the DataManager initialises, and so this may need to be
forced by the application at start-up or it may not have been read
before it is used. NB: make sure that the configuration file ends with
a newline (or the last line will be silently ignored!).<br>
<h2>Notes</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Not all branches of EQUIP are up-to-date with respect to this,
especially support changes in equip.discovery. If in doubt use a
version of equip4j from a build of the CVS HEAD.</li>
</ul>
<h2>No multicast...</h2>
If your VPN (or other network) isn't supporting multicast then...<br>
<h3>Equip Discovery<br>
</h3>
equip.discovery can make use of a unicast reflector as a rendezvous<br>
1. Run the reflector; default port is 4170.<br>
<pre>java equip.discovery.DiscoveryRendezvous &lt;udp-port&gt;<br></pre>
Program will print a discovery URL ("<span
 style="font-family: monospace;">equipd://&lt;rendezvous-ip&gt;:&lt;port&gt;</span>")
that should be used to talk to it...<br>
2. Configure the client, typically in the equip.eqconf file (see above)<br>
<pre>...<br>discoveryUrls: equipd://&lt;rendezvous-ip&gt;:&lt;port&gt;<br>...<br></pre>
(Make sure there is a newline at the end of the file).<br>
<h3>Streaming Media</h3>
There is now (another) RTP unicast bridge/reflector in CVS <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">Equator/AccessGrid/multicast-bridge/MulticastBridge.java</span><br>
Use that :-)<br>
