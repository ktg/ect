<h1>Introduction to EQUIP</h1>

<P>
EQUIP has been developed within the Equator IRC as an integration platform and 
middleware solution for the various activities and projects within Equator. 
EQUIP is based around the concept of a shared dataspace. Information producers
can publish information to a dataspace, and can keep this information up-to-date.
Information consumers can use pattern-based techniques to register their information
interests with a dataspace, which can then information about any data changes to them.
</P>

<P>
EQUIP is an item of cross-platform and cross-language software, which provides for 
easy interoperation between Java and C++ through the use of cross-language
and cross-platform type definitions and serialization formats. It also supports
easy extensibility through the inclusion of run-time class loading in both Java
and C++.
</P>

<P>
EQUIP4j is a Java-only subset of EQUIP, which uses the same source files, but which uses <a href="http://ant.apache.org/">Apache Ant</A> as a build system, and which is quite a bit more accessible for Java programmers than the full dual-language system.
