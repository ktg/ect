<h3><a name="introduction">Introduction</h3>

ECT is an piece of software which aims to support the rapid deployment of 
ubiquitous computing
experiences. This document explains our motiviation for developing
ECT, introduces some of the concepts that you will need to understand in 
order to use it, and describes some of the useful features
that ECT provides.

<h3><a name="ubicomp">What is ubiquitous computing?</h4>

<i>Ubiquitous computing</i> (ubicomp) is a broad field of research, which
involves investigations into the integration
of computational devices into the environment. A short
introduction to ubicomp can be found 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubiquitous_computing">here</a>,
and a longer introduction can be found
<a href="http://www.ubiq.com/hypertext/weiser/UbiHome.html">here</a>.
Ubicomp is also sometimes called <i>pervasive computing</i>.
Installations of ubicomp devices in non-research settings
(eg in museums, people's homes etc) are sometimes called
<i>ubiquitous computing experiences</i>.

<h3><a name="motivation">Motivation</h3>

<P>
The development of ECT has been motivated by previous work 
involving the construction of ubiquitous computing experiences
undertaken as part of the 
<a href="http://www.sics.se/accord/index.html" 
target="_blank">ACCORD</a> project
and the 
<a href="http://www.equator.ac.uk"
target="_blank">EQUATOR</a> Interdisplinary 
Research Collaboration (IRC). Work in ACCORD focussed on the
construction of domestic ubicomp experience, and ongoing work
in EQUATOR has focussed on themes such as 
<a href="http://www.equator.ac.uk/index.php/articles/summary/c64/"
target="_blank">Playing and Learning</a>,
<a href="http://www.equator.ac.uk/index.php/articles/summary/c62/"
target="_blank">Citywide Performance</a> and
<a href="http://www.equator.ac.uk/index.php/articles/summary/c63/"
target="_blank">Digital Care</a>.
</p>
<P>
Although the ubicomp experiences constructed as part of these 
activities have been very different, a common theme that
has emerged from all of them is that the construction
of experiences is difficult and time-consuming to get right. Some
common problems that have been encountered include:
</P>

<ul>
<li>developing software to control individual ubicomp devices from computers
can be difficult, due to restrictions on the programming language
needed to talk to the device, and the type and versions of libraries
used by this software
<li>if ubicomp experiences are distributed over a wide area, then
setting up an infrastructure to allows computers to communicate with
devices can be difficult and expensive - eg if might rely upon the 
laying of large amounts of cabling. In many environments where we might
install ubicomp experiences, such as in the home, then may not 
even be possible to do this
<li>designing a software architecture that supports the control of multiple
distributed devices, which may be connected to multiple computers,
is also a difficult problem
</ul>

<P>
ECT has been developed as a result of the experiences that have
been gained in solving these particular problems in the activities listed
above. ECT allows:

<ul>
<li>users to specify which item of software on a particular computer
should be used to communicate with a particular device attached to
that computer
<li>a chosen item of software on one computer 
to be controlled from any other computer which is connected over
a TCP/IP netowrk. Since network connections
can be wireless, this can solve the problem of having to lay
large amounts of cabling
<li>complex behaviours to be specified by a combination of 
software items intended to control devices and software items which performs
processing operations - eg logic gates, queues for items of data
gathered from sensors, scripts which express complex behaviours
</ul>

<P>
As such, the ECT package is a combination of 

<ul>
<li>middleware facilities
implementing an architecture that supports the construction of ubicomp experiencs
<li>a set of software items (referred to as <i>components</i>) 
which can be used to communicate with specific devices, to generate control
instructions for devices, and to process and display
data which has been gathered from such devices
</ul>

ECT is currently provided with over 80 components, which allow it to
communicate with a wide range of physical devices.

</p>

<h3><a name="concepts">Concepts</h3>

This section introduces some of the concepts necessary
to understand and use ECT.

<h4>Components</h4>

<P>
ECT uses the term <i>component</i> to refer to an item of software
running on a particular computer which can be used to control
a particular device. For a piece of software to be usable as
a component in ECT,
it must conform to certain requirements (although there will be 
many existing items of software that already conform to these
requirements and that will therefore be directly usable
in ECT without modification). ECT is supplied with a large number of
components to allow interactions with popular ubicomp devices,
and many of these components are listed in component 
documentation provided on this web-site (for example,
 see the <a href="javadoc/categorisedComponents.html">Categorised 
components list</a>).
</P>

<P>
It should be noted that, in addition to the components supplied
with ECT that can be used to control hardware devices, ECT is
also supplied with a number of software-only components that
can be used to perform processing operations. For example,
<a href="javadoc/componentfiles/equip.ect.components.dynamicbsh.DynamicBeanShell.html">Dynamic BeanShell</a> is a component that allows scripts
written in the <a href="http://www.beanshell.org">BeanShell</a> 
language to be used in the ECT environment.
</p>

<h4>Component properties</h4>

<P>
All components define named properties, which can be used to 
control their operation, and as a result the operation
of any hardware device with which they may commmunicate. 
For example, the 
Camera component, which can be used to take a picture using
a webcam, defines the following properties:

<ul>
<li>configCaptureDevice
<li>triggerImageCapture
<li>imageLocation
</ul> 

Users control components by providing values to properties.
In this case, a user who wishes to use this component with 
a webcam must first locate the ID of the camera
they wish to use (see the <a href="javadoc/componentfiles/equip.ect.components.camera.Camera.html">Camera component online docs</a> for information about
how this ID can be determined). This ID must then be provided to 
the component through its 
<i>configCaptureDevice</i> property.

On receipt of this ID, 
the component will attempt to connect to the camera that this specifies.
After the component has connected, a user must trigger the camera
to take a picture by providing a value to the
<i>triggerImageCapture</i> property. This will cause the software
component to communicate with the camera and request it to 
record an image. When this has occured, the component will then
place the URL of this image onto the <i>imageLocation</i>
property. This URL might then be used by other components
(for example, the 
<a href="javadoc/componentfiles/equip.ect.components.simplemediaviewer.SimpleMediaViewer.html">Simple Media Viewer</a> component can be used
to view the image that can be found at this URL).
</P>

<P>
Note that the names of some of the properties on the 
Camera component are examples of property names that follow
certain conventions (you will also find these conventions regularly used
in other ECT components):

<ul>
<li>properties with names starting with <i>config</i>
represent configuration information for the component, and normally
all config properties have to be specified by a user before
the component is usable
<li>properties with names starting with <i>trigger</i>
are used to make the component perform an action. Specifying
any value to these properties will trigger this action
</ul>
</p>

<h4>Containers</h4>
<p>
In general a component which communicates with a particular
device will run on the computer to which the device is attached,
and may require the installation of various items of driver
software on that machine for its operation (requirements for 
driver installation are documented by each component - for an
example, see the <a href="javadoc/componentfiles/equip.ect.components.phidgets.PhidgetInterfaceKit.html">PhidgetInterfaceKit</a> component). 
</P>
<P>
However, in general, properties defined by a ECT component running on 
one computer are controllable using ECT from another computer, as
long as this computer is 
connected over a network and is also running ECT. To 
allow components to be controlled in this way, 
ECT has the concept of a <i>container</i>,
which is an item of software which runs on a computer, and which
manages the components running on that machine.
</p>
<P>
A container must be installed onto every machine on which
components should run. When a container is started up, it will
<ul>
<li>locate all components which have been installed on the machine
<li>examine the properties defined by each component
<li>advertise the availability of the component to other machines
on the network
</ul>

Once other machines on the network have seen a component advert
(known in ECT as a <i>capability</i>) they can

<ul>
<li>make a request to the container for an instance of the component
<li>make a request to the container to modify the values of any
properties defined by the component
</ul>

The container is then responsible for manipulating components
to fulfill these requests.

</P>
<P>
Note for developers - ECT is currently supplied with a container
written in Java, which is capable of hosting components which are
defined as JavaBeans. Properties of a supplied bean are then
interpretted by ECT as being properties of the component.
See ECT Developer documentation for more information.
</P>

<h4>Specifying complex behaviour</h4>

<P>
Although components provided with ECT can simplify the process
of setting up software that can control ubicomp devices, 
setting up a ubicomp experience is likely to involve much
more work than just installing ECT on a cluster of machines,
attaching devices to machines, installing drivers for devices,
and configuring components that can communicate with these
devices. Designers are likely to wish to specify 
much more complex behaviours in theirs systems than can 
be provided using this process alone. 
</p>

<P>
The primary mechanism in ECT for the specification of behaviour
involves the creation of connections between properties
on different components. Connections can be established 
between components, even when they are hosted in containers
running on different machines. If a connection exists between
two properties, and if one of these properties is set to a new 
value, then ECT will propogate this new value to any other 
connected properties. Note that new values might be supplied
by either users or by the component to which the property
belongs.
</P>

<P>
A simple example of this connection mechanism might involve
two components - a 
<a href="javadoc/componentfiles/equip.ect.components.camera.Camera.html">
Camera</a>
component and a 
<a href="javadoc/componentfiles/equip.ect.components.simplemediaviewer.SimpleMediaViewer.html">
Simple Media Viewer</a> component. If a connection is created
between the <i>imageLocation</i> property of the Camera 
components, and between the <i>browserURL</i> property of 
a Simple Media Viewer component, then every time the 
Camera component triggers its attached device to take a picture, 
the URL where this picture can be found will be placed
on the <i>imageLocation</i> property, and will get 
propogated along the connection to the Simple Media Viewer
<i>browserURL</i> property. This will cause the 
picture at that URL to appear in a browser window maintained by 
the Simple Media Viewer component. This browser window can 
easily be on a different machine to the one to which the 
camera device is attached.
</P>

<P>
Of course, there are limitations to the complexity of behaviour
that can be specified by this property connection mechanism.
Adding connections between components representing hardware 
devices
 is useful in the creation of
reactive systems (eg ones in which the principal behaviour of
the system involves a number of events causing a number of actions).
However, it is not sufficient to create systems which
exhibit data processing functionality. In ECT at present, 
data processing functionality can be added through the 
addition of software-only components. These are components
which are still controlled through the modification of property
values, and which can therefore be connected to components
representing hardware devices, but which themselves do not
connect to any hardware device. Instead, they may provide
useful data storage or processing functionality.
</p>
<P>
ECT is currently provided with a wide range of software-only
components, which have been developed to add 
behavioural features to existing installations. Examples of
software-only components include

<ul>
<li>email clients - allow emails to be sent and received
<li>rss clients - can be used to monitor an rss feed
<li>queuing components - allow items of data to be added to 
and retrieved from a queue
<li>data input and output components - provide graphical 
interfaces to gather and display different types of data
<li>logic operations - can apply logic functions to 
boolean data (ie data which only takes the value true or false)
<li>function operations - can be used to specify functions
that should be applied to numeric data
<li>many more ... 
</ul>

</P>

<h4>Installations</h4>

<P>
The combination of 

<ul>
<li>a cluster of machines running ECT
<li>the instances of components that a user has requested on these machines
<li>the connections that a user has established between 
properties on these components
<li>the state of the system (ie the values that have been placed
onto component properties)
</ul>

is referred to within ECT as an <i>installation</i>. An installation
is just another term for a ubicomp experience that has been created
using ECT.
</P>
<P>
ECT provides functionality to manage multiple installations. Computers
running ECT can be involved in multiple installations at once, 
and users can switch between different installations that have been
created at different times. This process works as follows:

<ul>
<li>for a particular installation, one computer in the cluster
is defined as the <i>installation master</i>. User interface
functionality on this machine is used to create a new installation,
to give it a name and to give it a password (referred to as an
<i>installation secret</i>).
<li>other machines in the cluster can then join the installation
by providing this name and secret. These machines are then
referred to as <i>slaves</i>
<li>it is likely that user interface functionality on the master
machine will be used to view components available on other machines
in the cluster, to request instances of components, to 
establish connections between them, and to set other property values
<li>details of any installation built will be stored on the master 
machine
<li>at any point, the master machine can be used to shut down
an installation, which will cause component instances to 
involved in an installation to be deleted from the machines on 
which they are running
<li>the master machine can also opt to re-start any of the installations
that have previously been stored on it. If this occurs, then
any components required for the installation will be recreated, any
connections will be added, and any stored property values will be set
</ul>

</P>

<P>
Note that it is of course possible to run ECT on just one computer
(rather than on all computers in a cluster) and if an installation
is created on this computer, then this computer will automatically
be the master computer for the installation.
</P>

<h3><a name="gui">Graphical user interfaces</a></h3>

<P>
The first part of this document has described core concepts
and entities in
ECT, including <i>components</i>, <i>component properties</i>,
<i>containers</i>, <i>connections</i> and <i>installations</i>.
The rest of this documentent briefly introduces the different
types of graphical user interface (GUI) functionality which are
provided with ECT to manipulate these entities.
</P>
<P>
Different types of GUI functionality have been provided with ECT
which are targetted at the needs of different categories of users.
Types of functionality currently include:
</P>

<h4>The graph editor and capability browser</h4>

<P>
The combination of the graph editor and capability browser
is currently the most commonly used interface 
to ECT, and as such is also the most
well-developed and bug-free. This section gives a brief 
overview of the functionality of this interface - 
for much more detail, including a number of screenshots of these
interfaces - follow the <a href="user/current/ECT_Webstart_User_Guide.html">
Learning to use ECT</a> tutorial.
</P>
<P>
The capability browser is a window that displays 
views of all components that are available
in any container which has been attached to 
a particular ECT installation. It allows users to view 
any documentation defined by a particular component, 
request that an instance of a component be created, and
to request that existing instances of components be deleted.
</P>

<P>
Once a component instance has been created through the capability
browser, it will appear in the graph editor. This allows
users to view the properties defined by a component, 
modify any values they may have, and to establish 
connections between properties. As properties on components change
(for example, when caused by someone providing an input using
a hardware device) then these property changes appear on the
graph editor, and if a user uses the capability browser to delete
a component instance, it will disappear from the graph editor.
</P>

<h4>Display editor (experimental)</h4>

The display editor is currently an experimental piece of software,
which is intended for use by users that are less computer-literate
than those that may wish to use the graph editor. It 
has been optimised for use through a touch-screen interface. 
For a tutorial about using the display editor in 
combination with the graph editor, read
<a href="user/current/displaytutorial.html">Using the display editor</a>.

<h4>Physical configuration editor (experimental)</h4>

The physical configuration editor is another experimental piece of
software. It allows logical statements and inferences to be made
about a ubicomp system. More information about the display editor
will appear on this web-site soon.

<h4>Scripter application (experimental)</h4>

This is an application that allows scripts to be developed that 
can control complex components. As such, scripting is an 
alternative mechanism for the specification of complex 
behaviour in a ubicomp system than the construction of graphs. For
an introduction to using the scripter, please read 
<a href="user/current/scripter.html"/>Using the scripter</a>
