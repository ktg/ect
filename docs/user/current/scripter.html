<h3><a name="overview">Overview</a></h3>

<P>
The Scripter is an experimental application that allows a user 
to manipulate ECT components by writing scripts
(rather than by specifying component configurations 
graphically through
the <a href="ECT_Webstart_User_Guide.html">Graph Editor</a>). 
Scripts are written in a version of the 
<a href="http://www.beanshell.org">BeanShell</a> language
which has had extra feature added to make it usable
in this situation. The Scripter application provides
functionality which can assist a user in the development of 
a script, and to browse details of a script which is 
currently being executed.
</P>
<P>
Scripts developed and used in the scripter application have
access to any components that are available through the
Graph Editor. As such, they are allowed to access and modify any 
properties defined by such components, thereby allowing
scripts to manipulate any hardware devices associated
with a component. It is also possible to develop scripts
that can perform tasks when the values
of any monitored properties change, and it is hoped that 
the combination of these simple facilities, along with the
general purpose scripting facilities provided by BeanShell,
will provide sufficient flexibility to specify many
different ubicomp installations.
</P>

<P>
In fact, it may well be the case that specifications
of complex behaviours involving large numbers of components
may well be simpler through the use of scripting than
through the use of the graph editor, as complex graphs
can become difficult to understand, maintain and 
expand. 
</P>

<P>
The rest of this section describes how to get started 
with the Scripter, and describes how to construct 
a simple installation using software-only components.
It is hoped that this will provide sufficient information
to users who wish to construct more complex installations.
The section assumes that the reader is familiar with
the ECT graph editor, and associated technologies.
You should follow the 
<a href="ECT_Webstart_User_Guide.html">Learning to use ECT</a>
tutorial if this is not the case (and also
the <a href="../../ect_overview.html">ECT Overview</a> if 
you are not familiar with the ECT system.
</P>

<h3><a name="getting_started">Getting started</a></h3>

<P>
To get started with the Scripter, you will need to have
downloaded and unzipped the latest full release of ECT
(rather than the cut-down release). 
See the 
<a href="ECT_Webstart_Getting_Started.html">Getting Started</a>
guide for information on how to do this. Then follow this 
procedure (assumes that you are working on a windows machine):
</P>

<P>
<ol>
<li>Follow <a href="ECT_Webstart_Getting_Started.html#method2">
Method 2</a> in the Getting Started guide to launch
the graph editor through a mechanism which is suitable for
experimental pieces of software such as the Scripter.
<li>locate the <tt>install</tt> directory 
(with the <tt>ect</tt> and <tt>java</tt> directories in 
your unzipped ECT installation and double click on the
<tt>runScripter.bat</tt> file
</ol>
</P>

<P>
You should now have 4 seperate graphical windows, labelled:

<ul>
<li>ECT Java Container
<li>Capability Browser
<li>Graph Component Editor
<li>Scripter
</ul>
</P>

<P>
Of these, the last three windows are important to the scripter. You should
use the Capability Browser to create instances of 
any components that you want to control through a script. These 
components will then appear on the Graph Component Editor. The Scripter
window is used to write and test scripts, and any connections created 
by a script will also appear in the Graph Component Editor.  
</P>

<h3><a name="scripter">The Scripter window</h3>

<P>
The scripter window will look something like figure 1
below:
</P>
<IMG src="images/scripter/scripter_window.gif"><BR>
<B>Figure 1</B>
<P>
The white text area on this window contains an example script
(starting <tt>inputs:...</tt>).
The three buttons above this text area are used to start the
execution of this script (left button), stop the execution
of a running script (middle button) and to browse
any errors produced by a script (right button). The current 
example script does not do anything useful without the
creation of any components to control, so you shouldn't run it.
Instead, the example section of this document will demonstrate
how to build a simple example to show how the Scripter works.
</P>

<h3><a name="simple_example">Constructing a simple example</h3>

<ol>
<li>Create an instance of the TestingTextFieldInput component
through the 
capability browser.
<li>In the graph component editor, select this new component,
drag it down to the editor pane, then right click on 
the top section of the component in the editor pane, and
select the "Settings" option on the pop-up menu.
<li>Using the Component Settings dialog that appears, change
the name of the component to something shorter
(eg TextInput), then close the dialog.
<li>Using the same procedure, create an instance of
the TestingTextFieldOutput, and change its name to something
shorter (eg TextOutput)
<li>Now delete the existing example script in the 
Scripter window, and replace it with the following:

<pre>
inputs:
  TextInput.value as String in
outputs:
  TextOutput.value as String out
state:
status:
on in:
  out = in;
</pre>

<li>Click the run button on the scripter window. A message
should appear on the bottom of the window indicating that 
the script is now running

<li>associated with the TestingTextFieldInput component should be 
a window containing a text input field, and with the
TestingTextFieldOutput component should be a window which can
output text. Locate these windows, type some text into the
input field and press return. If the script is running 
properly, you should find that the text is copied by the
script to the output window, without you having to 
add an edge between these components in the graph editor.
</ol>

<h3><a name="understanding">Understanding how the script works</h3>

This script consists of five seperate sections, labelled
<B>inputs</b>,<b>outputs</b>,<b>state</b>,<b>status</b> and
<b>on in</B>, although the state and status sections are
empty. This section describes the function of the <b>inputs</b>, 
<B>outputs</b>
and <b>on in</b> sections.

<h4>inputs section</h4>

<P>
This section is used to define the component properties 
that are to be used as inputs to the script. In the example
script above, this section only has one line:
</P>

<pre>
inputs:
  TextInput.value as String in
</pre>

<P>
This line means that property <i>value</i> on a component
named <i>TextInput</i> will be considered as an input
to the script, and that this property will be referable
to using the variable <i>in</i> throughout the rest
of the script.
</P>

<P>
Users can add as many different properties as they wish
to the <B>inputs</B> section, providing that each is
given a different variable name. 
</P>

<h4>outputs section</h4>

<P>
This section is used to define the component properties
to which this script will output values, and in the
example script above, this section also only has
one line:
</p>

<pre>
outputs:
  TextOutput.value as String out
</pre>

<P>
In this case, this means that property <i>value</i>
of component <i>TextOutput</i> will be used as an output
of the script, and will be referable to through the
variable <i>out</i>
</P>

<h4>on in section</h4>

<P>
This section specified what actions should occur 
when the value in variable <i>in</i> changes. Since
this variable refers to property <i>value</i>
of the component named <i>TextInput</i>, then this
allows a user to specify an action to be performed
when this property changes. In this case, the
action that is to be performed is to set the variable
<i>out</i> to the value of the variable <i>in</i>:
</P>

<pre>
on in:
  out = in;
</pre>

<P>
Since variable <i>out</i> refers to property
<i>value</i> of the component named <i>TextOutput</i>, then
this has the effect of setting this property to the 
value of the <i>value</i> property of the <i>TextInput</i>
component.
</P>
<P> 
Note that the text in this section, ie the line that
says <tt>out = in;</tt> is called a <i>scriptlet</i>. Scriptlets
can consist of multiple lines of BeanShell code, but please
ensure that these lines are seperated by a semi-colon, eg
</P>

<pre>
on in:
  in = in/2;
  out = in;
</pre>

<h4>How do scripts appear in the Graph Editor</h4>

<P>
After having started the script running, take a look
at the graph editor window, which might look something
like figure 2 below:
</P>
<IMG src="images/scripter/scripter_component_in_graph.gif"/><BR>
<B>Figure 2</B>
<P>
The component labelled <I>ScripterGUI.main</i> has been created
by the Scripter application, and you can see that
it has properties which correspond to variables
defined in the input and output sections of the script,
as described above. These properties are connected to the
properties of other components from which they take input, and
to which they provide output, and these connections have
also been created automatically by the Scripter application.
</P>

<h3><a name="advanced">Advanced features of the Scripter</h3>

The Scripter application provides some features that
can assist you in the development and testing of scripts. Some
of these are described below:

<h4>Adding a new input/output to a script</h4>

Rather than having to add line such as 

<pre>
TextInput.value as String in
</pre>

<P>
to a script by directly typing it, the Scripter provides graphical
features that can assist. Move your cursor to the place
where you want a new line to be added, and select either
<tt>Input...</tt> or <tt>Output...</tt> from the <tt>Insert</tt> 
menu. You will then be shown a dialog that looks something like
figure 3 below:
</P>
<IMG src="images/scripter/select.gif"><BR>
<B>Figure 3</b>

<P>
This displays a selection of lines that might be added. Click
on one, and click <tt>OK</tt>, and this line will be added
at the position where your cursor is. If you add any components
to your graph whilst viewing this dialog, then you might have
to click <tt>Refresh</tt> for any properties you have to appear
in the dialog.
</P>

<h4>Viewing script variables</h4>

<P>
Whilst the script is running, you can view the status of 
any variables that it defines. To do this, select
the <tt>Variables</tt> option from the <tt>View</tt> menu, 
which will launch a dialog looking something like figure
4 below:
</P>
<IMG src="images/scripter/variables.gif"><BR>
<B>Figure 4</B>

<P>
In this case, this indicates that the script
has two variables named <I>in</i> and <i>out</i>, gives
their values, indicates that they are linked to a component
(ie their <i>Link Status</i> is given as OK) and gives
the name of the property of the component to which they are linked.
</P>
