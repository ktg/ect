<h3>Setting up the Active Map in the Physical Configuration Manager</h3>
<ol>
<li><b>Run the Physical Configuration Manager</b><br />
To run the physical configuration manager, you just need to run the ant target
<code>runphysicalconfigurationmgr2</code>. You'll need the
<a href="http://java.sun.com/webservices/downloads/webservicespack.html">Java
Web Services pack</a> installed to be able to compile the physical configuration
manager. Change the <code>jwsdp_home</code> property in the ant build file to point
to directory you installed the web service pack to.<br />
The <code>runphysicalconfigurationmgr2</code> connects to a running equip dataspace
and specifies a configuration file to load. You'll want to change the file loaded to 
<code>{$resources}/physicalconfigurations/joystick_component_auto_create_with_images.xml</code>,
since thats the file we'll be using for this example. You can also change the equip
dataspace, if its not on the local machine or isn't on a standard port.</li>
<li><b>Add a joystick</b><br />
To tell the physical configuration manager that you have a joystick, select 
Add-&gt;Add New Physical Thing... In the dialog, select <code>ClassThing Joystick,
Logitech Wingman RumblePad, USB1.1</code>, and click Ok. Some of the other fields,
such as width, depth and colour will be filled in from the ClassThing. It will ask
if you want to add sub-parts too. Say yes, otherwise you'll get a joystick with no
buttons, which isn't much use to anyone. The new physical thing representing the
joystick will be added to the tree under 'Other Things'.
Now we need to tell the physical configuration manager that the joystick in plugged
into this computer. So, select the joystick, and click Add-&gt;Add New Relationship...
Search for something called 'Host <i>&lt;computername&gt;</i>' in the drop down list
for the object. The relationship should be '<code>is plugged into</code>'.
</li>
<li><b>Check Rules</b><br />
The physical configuration maanger now knows we have a joystick connected to the
computer, and it can see a JoystickInterface SoftwareComponent capability in the
dataspace, so it can use rules deduce that we want a JoystickInterface component
in order to talk to the connected joystick. So, when you first click Rules-&gt;Check
Rules, it will request a JoystickInterface component. The JoystickInterface 
component is a factory, creating JoystickProxy components for each joystick. So, 
when you run Check Rules again it gets the JoystickProxy component for the Wingman
joystick. It also adds a relationship from each of physical joystick buttons to the
JoystickProxy property for each button. This allows the Active map for find the state
for each button.
</li>
<li><b>Add the Lounge</b><br />
Again, select Add-&gt;Add New Physical Thing..., but this time select <code>ClassThing
Lounge</code> and click Ok. Finally, all you need to do is say that the joystick is in
the lounge, so select the joystick, and Add-&gt;Add New Location...<br />
The location relationship is 'is in'. Its relative to the new physical lounge thing you
just created. Not <code>ClassThing Lounge</code>, which is a mistake I've made various
times. It should be the very last PhysicalThing in the drop down list.
</li>
<li><b>Display the Map</b><br />
Select the lounge thing you created, and click Show-&gt;Active Map. Voila!
</li></ol>
