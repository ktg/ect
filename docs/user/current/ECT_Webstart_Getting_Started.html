<h3><a name="intro">Introduction</a></h3>

This document explains how to download and install ECT, and how
to run the ECT graph editor. It assumes that you have 
read the <a href="../../ect_overview.html">ECT Overview</a>.

<h3><a name="pre">Prerequisites</h3>

<P>
For best results we recommend that you install ECT on a computer
running Microsoft Windows (2000 or above). Many of the current 
components require or are better supported on this. 
However, some of the components should work on other platforms
(though this has not necessarily been tested). Our recommended
Java installation is the Sun Java SDK 1.4.2, but 
we have encountered no problems with using 
Sun Java JDK 1.5. You should make sure that 
<a href="http://java.sun.com/products/javawebstart/index.jsp">Java
WebStart</a> is installed - this will either be automatically installed
with the SDK, or in some (older?) SDKs you will
find a webstart installer in the SDK directories.
</P>

<h3><a name="component">Component dependencies</h3>
Many of the components provided with ECT (such as the 
<a href="http://www.phidgets.com/" target="_blank">Phidgets</a> components) require
libraries to be installed. Please refer to individual component 
documentation to find out details. You can find out how
to examine component documentation through ECT by following the 
<a href="ECT_Webstart_User_Guide.html">Learning to use ECT</a> 
tutorial, or you can view component documentation which
is provided through these web-pages (eg see the
<a href="../../javadoc/categorisedComponents.html">Categorised components list</a>
and click on the link for a particular component).

<h3><a name="start">Getting the software</h3>
<P>
There are two methods for downloading, installing and ECT. 
These are:
</P>

<ul>
<li>Downloading a binary release
<li>Building the software from source code
</ul>

<P>
For most users, the recommended approach is to download and install
a binary release. Two different binary releases are available:

<ul>
<li>a minimal release, which includes a full set of ECT components
and the graph editor 
<li>a full release, which additionally includes source code and experimental interfaces to ECT (including the scripter and the display editor)
</ul>

You can download current and old releases from the menu on the left-hand side
 of this page.

</p>

<P>
Note that, for users who are familiar with CVS, Java and Ant technologies,
it is possible to obtain and build ECT source code. 
You should read the
<a href="../../developer/current/ECT_Build_notes.html">
Building ECT</a> document
for further instructions on how to do this.
</P>

</P>

Download either of these zip files and unzip them to a directory on
your file system. 

<h3><a name="starting">Starting ECT</h3>

<P>
ECT consists of a number of different graphical interfaces
which all share the same software infrastructure, and
include the Graph Editor, the Display Editor, the 
Physical Configuration Manager and the Scripter. See
the <a href="../../ect_overview.html">ECT Overview</a> for
an introduction to the purpose of each of these interfaces.
However, most users will want to start with the Graph Editor,
as this is the most general purpose and tested interface
in the ECT system.
</P>

<P>
There are two methods to start up the graph editor,
the choice of which is dependent upon whether you wish
to work with some of the more experimental features
of ECT. User who only wish to use the graph editor
or display editor
should use method 1 below - this is the recommended
method for most users, and only requires the
minimal version of ECT referred to above. It launches
a number of features (such as installation and container
management) that are not accessable through method 2
below. However, users who wish to use the 
<a href="scripter.html">Scripter</a> or the
<a href="Using_Processing_with_ECT.html">ECT procesing integration</a>
should
use method 2 below, which launches a simpler version
of ECT. This method requires the full release of ECT
referred to above. Note that it is intended that
experimental features of ECT will be migrated
from method 2 to method 1 at an appropriate point
in their development.

<h4><a name="method1">Method 1 (recommended)</h4>

On a Windows system, double click on the directory
into which you have expanded the ECT zip file, 
and then successively on the <tt>ect</tt>,<tt>java</tt> and
<tt>webstart</tt> directories, and then locate the
<tt>runWebstart.bat</tt> script. Double click on this script
to start of the process of loading the graph editor.
You can follow a detailed tutorial, 
<a href="ECT_Webstart_User_Guide.html">
Learning to use ECT</a>
for more information about what to do next.

<h4><a name="method2">Method 2 (experimental)</h4>

On a Windows system, double click on the directory
into which you have expanded the ECT zip file, and
then successively on the <tt>ect</tt>,<tt>java</tt>
and <tt>install</tt> directories. Then double click
(in this order) on the following batch files in the
install directory:

<ol>
<li>runEquipDataSpace.bat
<li>runExporterGUI.bat
<li>runGraphEditor.bat
</ol>
