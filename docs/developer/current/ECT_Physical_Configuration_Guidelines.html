<h1>ECT Physical Configuration Guidelines/Notes</h1>
Chris Greenhalgh, 2005-09-21<br>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
The Physical Configuration Manager is a work-in-progress and concept
demonstrator, exploring the explicit modelling of the physical
(non-software) elements of an ECT installation to support
configuration, understanding (including analysis) and behaviour
specification. Here are some notes/thoughts about current explorations,
what to put in the XML files and what kinds of rules to have, etc.<br>
<h2>General</h2>
Some basic reasoning can be done to make subsequent rules more concise
- see <a
 href="../../../old/resources/physicalconfigurations/facts_common.xml">facts_common.xml</a>:<br>
<ul>
  <li>a thing with identifier of type T =&gt; fact: thing, T, value</li>
  <li>for all thing/class relationships (including superclasses) =&gt;
fact: thing, hasclass, class <br>
  </li>
  <li>similarly =&gt; fact: thing, hasclassname, classtitle</li>
  <li>if a thing has type (thingtype) which is also the title of a
class then =&gt; fact: thing, hasclass, class (i.e. the class must
exist, e.g. "Host", etc. - see below).<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Configuration</h2>
Support for configuration is currently primarily:<br>
<ul>
  <li>creating the appropriate device interface (proxy) components for
any connected devices;</li>
  <li>configuring such device interface components as appropriate.</li>
</ul>
<h3>ECT Introspected Information<br>
</h3>
In general, ("thingtype") Host, SoftwareContainer,
SoftwareComponentCapability/SoftwareComponent and
SoftwareComponentProperty (in that Part-of hierarchy) are created by
introspection. All are Physical Things (in Physical Configuration
Manager schema). The identifiers are currently:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Host (only created if capabilities are present at the moment):</li>
  <ul>
    <li>"hostname" e.g. "kubrick"</li>
    <li>"title" e.g. "kubrick" or "java on kubrick"
(capability.getHostID())<br>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <li>SoftwareContainer:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>"guid" e.g. "[128.243.87.134:0.1689:1:1127220035]"</li>
    <li>"title" e.g. "kubrick" or "java on kubrick"
(capability.getHostID())<br>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <li>SoftwareComponentCapability:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>"guid" (capability.getID())</li>
    <li>"title" e.g. "PhidgetLCD" (capability.getCapabilityName())<br>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <li>SoftwareComponent:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>"guid" (component.getID())</li>
    <li>"title" e.g. "PhidgetInterfaceKit" <br>
    </li>
    <li>"componentrequestguid" </li>
  </ul>
  <li>SoftwareComponentProperty:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>"guid"</li>
    <li>"title", e.g. "configSerialNumber"</li>
    <li>"value", e.g. "-1"<br>
    </li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<h3>General Component Creation Strategy</h3>
The component creation strategy depends on whether there is <br>
<ul>
  <li>one directly requested component per device (e.g. EZIO, current
PhidgetInterfaceKit) or </li>
  <li>one directly requested component per device class or family,
which in turn makes device-specific sub-componented (e.g.
JoystickInterface, older PhidgquipFactory)<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>It also depends on whether the physical connection of the device to
the host has to be "qualified" or not, e.g. <br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>for most USB-connected device it does not matter which particular
USB port is used (unqualified), <br>
  </li>
  <li>whereas for RS-232 devices it is necessary to know which
particular (named) serial (COM) port it is connected to. <br>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>In the former case the device can be described as connected simply
to the host, while in the latter case it must be described as being
connected to a particular COM port which is part of the host.</p>
<p>In general, the type of a physical device is determined by the
"title" identifier of (one of) its class(es). <br>
