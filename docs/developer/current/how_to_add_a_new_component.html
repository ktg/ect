<h3><a name="intro">Introduction</h3>
<P>
This document is a brief introduction to the
process of adding a new component to ECT, which should not 
be too difficult if you are a competent
Java developer. It assumes that you are already familiar with using
ECT, and that you have experimented with a number of pre-written
components. 
</p>
<P>
The simplest way to start developing a new component is to obtain
the source code for ECT, as this includes a number of template
components that can be extended. Read the 
</a><a href="ECT_Build_Notes.html">Building ECT</a>
document for instructions on how do do this. Note that source code
for a particular ECT release can also be obtained by downloading
the <b>full</b> ECT archive (rather than the <b>webstart</b>
archive). 
</p>
Knowledge of using Apache Ant is assumed in the rest of this
document. This document also assumes that
you are familiar with the JavaBeans concept. If not, you should 
read up on this. Take a look at Sun's <a
 href="http://java.sun.com/products/javabeans/index.jsp" target="_blank">Java
Bean information
pages </a> and particularly the <a
 href="http://java.sun.com/developer/onlineTraining/Beans/JBeansAPI/shortcourse.html"
 target="_blank">JavaBeans tutorial</a>. </p>
<p>
<P>
Once you have worked through this document, you should also read the
<a href="ECT_Component_Guidelines.html">Component reference</a> for
more detailed information about component development, and the
<a href="documenting_components.html">Documentation reference</a>
for more detailed information about writing documentation for
components.
</p>
<p>
Finally, the best way to learn how to develop ECT components is to look
at existing examples, many of which are supplied with ECT. If you have
any questions about ECT development, please join our mailing list, 
as we will be happy to help you resolve them. 
</p>

<h3><a name="what">What is an ECT component?</h3>

<P>
At its simplest, an ECT component is just a JavaBean, packaged as 
a JAR. To take a look at some of the beans included with ECT 
already, take a look in the <tt>webstart/download/java/components</tt>
directory in your ECT installation - each file you find here
(eg <tt>template-component.jar</tt> will contain at least one bean,
and possibly more (eg <tt>template-component.jar</tt> currently
contains two). If you have any
pre-written java beans, you should just be able to
place them into this directory, and they should become available to 
ECT the next time you start it. So, if you can develop a JavaBean,
then you can develop an ECT component, and all you need to know
is how to add such a bean into a particular installation.
</p>

<P>
In more detail, you'll notice that components in ECT normally define a 
number of properties. For example, the <i>template</i> component
distributed with ECT defines a number of properties called
<tt>input</tt> and <tt>output</tt>. These are implemented in 
the source file for the template component
as pairs of methods
called <tt>setInput</tt> and <tt>getInput</tt>, and 
<tt>setOutput</tt> and <tt>getOutput</tt>
(see file <tt>/src/equip/ect/components/templates/Template.java</tt>)
. When a user 
uses the graphical interface to modify property <tt>input</tt>, then
the ECT system causes the <tt>setInput</tt> method on the
corresponding component to be called, As well, if ECT ever needs
to check the value of this property, is calls 
<tt>getInput</tt> to obtain the current propertly value.
</p>

<h3><a name="adding">Developing new components</a></h3>
<P>
Although it is possible to construct a bean outside of ECT, and
then to import that bean into ECT, this approach is not recommended.
For each bean, as well developing a valid class file conforming
to the JavaBean spec (eg <tt>Template.java</tt>) you would have
to construct a BeanInfo class (eg <tt>TemplateBeanInfo.java</tt>)
and a manifest file (eg <tt>manifest.mft</tt>) and package all these
files into the correct structure inside a JAR. This process is slightly
tricky, and mistakes can be made which can slow bean development. 
</p>
<P>
As an alternative, the ECT build system provides a number of tools
to help with the process of constructing a bean. To a first approximation,
all you have to do is write your bean source file (eg <tt>Template.java</tt>),
add a new target to the ECT build file (<tt>build.xml</tt>), and if 
you have set things up properly, ECT will generate a valid bean info,
package up your bean, and copy it to the correct installation automatically.
This approach saves a lot of time and errors!
</p>

The following instructions assume that
you have checked out module <i>ect</i> into directory
&lt;ect_home&gt;.
<ol>
  <li>Make a new directory for your component under
<tt>&lt;ect_home&gt;/ect/java/src/equip/ect/components</tt>
  (eg <tt>&lt;ect_home&gt;/ect/java/src/equip/ect/components/new_component</tt>)
  
  <li>copy Template.java into this directory and modify it so that
      it does what you want it to (hint - you'll need to change the package
      directive inside this source file, and you might want to change
      the name of the file and the class defined in it)
  <li>Modify build.xml so that it contains a target to build your components.
      You might like to copy the "template" target and modify it, as long
      as your component does not require any additional classpath 
      entries. Alternatively, if you component does need additional
      classpath entries (eg if it depends on another jar, for example)
      take a look at target "phidgets". Call
      your new target something like <tt>new_component</tt>
  <li>to build your component and to install, type the following
      into a command prompt:<BR><BR>
      <B>ant new_component</b><BR>
      <b>ant install</b><BR>
      <b>ant webstart</b><BR><BR>
  <li>run ECT, and hopefully your component will have appeared
</ol>
