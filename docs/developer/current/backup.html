<h2><a name="makingsub">Making components with sub-components</a></h2>
<a name="makingsub">Normal ("top-level") components are instantiated in
response to
explicit requests (normally from the capability browser). In some
situations components should be instantiated
dynamically by the system, e.g. components which exclusively proxy
hardware devices (e.g. camera, smart it, phidget) should be
instantiated when the correponding hardware is detected. The
recommended way to do this is via sub-components. For an example of how
this works see the subcomponenttest component.
</a>
<ul>
  <a name="makingsub"> <li>Create a component bean with bean info in
the normal way to
represent a factory or manager (a single instance of this will be
requested to bootstrap the process - it will create the dynamic
sub-components).</li>
  </a>
  <ul>
    <a name="makingsub"> <li>Give it a readonly property 'children'
with a public getter,
the type of which is a 1D array of the sub-component type (e.g. if the
subcomponent class is 'MySubComponent' then the getter signature would
be "public MySubComponent[] getChildren()"). If there are no children
then a zero sized array (not null) must be returned.<br>
    </li>
    <li>Fire the property change on 'children' whenever a child
component is added or removed (and update 'children' accordingly).</li>
    <li>When stopped ("public void stop()"), the manager component
should tidy up and destroy/stop all child components.<br>
    </li>
    </a>
  </ul>
  <a name="makingsub"> <li>Create a sub-component bean but WITHOUT
bean info (otherwise the
current component loaded will get confused). Consequently, you must
stick to java bean idiom, e.g. all public getX/setX methods will be
exposed as properties. <br>
  </li>
  </a>
  <ul>
    <a name="makingsub"> <li>The sub-component class must implement
Serializable.<br>
    </li>
    <li>The sub-component will be instantiated by the manager
component, and may accept arguments from it, e.g. internal references
to interface objects.</li>
    <li>The sub-component should expose bean properties appropriate for
the device (of whatever), and fire its own property change events.</li>
    <li>Each sub-component should have a String-type readonly property
called "persistentChild", the value of which is unique to this
particular sub-component (within the scope of other sub-components of
this manager). Without this, or if it is not consistent between
re-creations of the subcomponent then persitent links will not work
to/from this sub-component.<br>
    </li>
    </a>
  </ul>
</ul>
<h2><a name="makingper">Making components persistent </a></h2>
<p><a name="makingper">The dataspace will persist Component Requests
and Property Link
Requests. The container will also persist a components visible property
values, and try to re-set them when it is created. The configuration
manager allows components to be recreated in a similar way. Whereever
possible it is recommended that you make use of this form of
persistence, i.e. make the component's visible and settable properties
sufficient to recreate the component. See the </a><a
 href="ECT_Component_Guidelines.html">Component Development Guide</a>
for additional information about component life-cycle and configuration
property naming.</p>
<p>However, if this is not possible for some reason (e.g. much too much
state to expose as properties) then it is down to individual components
to persist their
own property values and/or internal state. The way to do this
at present is:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Your component bean should implement "equip.ect.Persistable", and
read/write its state from/to the specified file when requested. The
file format is down to the bean itself. Standard Java serialisation can
be used, but also consider persistance across changes to the component
class.</li>
</ul>
At present the container persists all components at a regular interval.
At some point this should be extended with consideration to (a) not
persisting too often (b) components being able to request persisting
(e.g. after a configuration change).<br>
<p>Note that components that persist themselve will not currently be
recreated correctly by the configuration manager, since it does not
have access to these container- and component-specific persistence
files.<br>
</p>
<h2><a name="makingrem">Making components remotely configurable</a></h2>
<a name="makingrem">Components can be remotely configured in two main
ways:<br>
</a>
<ol>
  <a name="makingrem"> <li>By exposing input properties for
configuration, which can be set
from other component properties via links. Advantage: configuration is
visible in the dataspace, and can be modified within the component
system. Disadvantage: relatively slow and restricted to strings and
simple types that have a coercion from string supported in ect. <br>
  </li>
  <li>By exposing an embedded configuration web server, exposing the
URL to this server via a property. E.g. see the httpconfigtextvalue
component.</li>
  </a>
</ol>
<a name="makingrem">These should normally be combined, so that web
server configuration is
reflected in properties and vice versa.<br>
The visionframework beans illustrate a short-cut of exposing a single
configuration property which may be parsed to extract more complex
configuration. The disadvantage of this is a more complex configuration
language, and relatively help/feedback in using it.<br>
At some point another ServiceUI approach could also be considered.<br>
</a>
<h2><a name="makinginv">Making components that directly invoke methods
on each other</a></h2>
<a name="makinginv">This is currently only supported for components
within the same JVM.
The component providing the methods to be called must provide a
readonly property whose value is an object which is NOT Serializable
and which implements the interface in question. The component which
will be calling these methods provides a readwrite property of the same
type. <br>
When the user makes Property Link Request FROM the interface provider
TO the interface caller then a string key will be passed via the
dataspace, but a (weak) reference to the actual underlying Java object
will be set as the property value (provided, as noted, it is in the
same JVM). The link destination component will then be able to invoke
methods on the interface implemented by the source component. <br>
See for example the visionframework, which pass video frames in this
way (via a callback handler to allow sources to split).<br>
