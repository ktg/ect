Although developing components for ECT is not a difficult task,
small mistakes made in this process can stop components working
as expected,
and debugging these mistakes can take some time. To help
in this process, we have compiled this page of hints and tips
to help developers to solve common problems. If you have a
hint or tip that you would like added to this page, please
email <a href="mailto:sre@cs.nott.ac.uk">Stefan Rennick Egglestone</a>.
Note that currently all of these hints and tips relate
to components developed in Java.

<ol>

<li><h4><i><a name="hint1">Component appears in capability browser,
but cannot be instantiated</i></h4>

<P>
Check that your component class implements 
interface <tt>java.io.Serializable</tt> - if not, then it should!
</p>

<li><h4><i><a name="hint2">Component doesn't appear in capability browser
at all</i></h4>

<P>
A number of possiblities here:

<ul>
<li>the package directive defined in your component class file 
doesn't match the directory in which you have placed this class file. 
This commonly happens if you have copied the template component
into a new directory, but have failed to modify
<tt>package equip.components.templates</tt> to 
<tt>package equip.components.&lt;new_directory_name&gt;</tt>
<li>a BeanInfo file isn't being generated properly for your
component - check directory <tt>&lt;ect_home&gt;\build\&lt;new_directory_name&gt;\equip\ect\components\&lt;new_directory_name&gt;</tt> to see if a correctly-named
BeanInfo file has been placed there. If it hasn't, you should check
the build file to make sure that it has been correctly set-up to 
auto-generate BeanInfo files (if you are using the auto-generation mechanism)
</ul>
</p>

<li><h4><i><a name="hint3">Although your component is making use of dynamic properties,
these properties don't appear in the graph editor</i></h4>

<P>
Check that your component implements interface 
<tt>equip.ect.DynamicProperties</tt> - dynamic properties will 
not work if it doesn't. If you are still struggling, take
a look at class <tt>equip.ect.components.phidgets.PhidgetInterfaceKit</tt>
for an example of how to use dynamic properties
</p>

<li><h4><i><a name="#hint4">Exporter GUI fails for no apparent reason</i></h4>

<P>
A couple of possibilities here:

<ul>
<li>has one of your components used up all the memory allocated to the Exporter GUI process? If so, you are likely to see 
<i>java.lang.OutOfMemoryException</i> reported by the Exporter GUI
<li>does one of your components have a string-typed property onto which
a string of length 65536 or more characters has been placed? If so, 
the Exporter GUI will fail with a UTFDataFormatException. If you
really need a property capable of holding such large amounts of character
data, you should instead type your property as a char [], and convert
internally between char [] and String representations as and when necessary
</ul>

</P>
