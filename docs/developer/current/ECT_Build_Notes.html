<h3><a name="cvs">Checking out the source code</h3>
<P>
ECT is currently hosted using CVS facilities provided by 
<a href="www.sf.net">SourceForge</a>. For instructions on how 
to check out modules from the EQUIP project at SourceForge, click
<a href="https://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=126969">here</a>.
The name of the module containing ECT within EQUIP project CVS is
<i>ect</i>.

<h3><a name="compiling">Compiling source code</h3>
<P>
To compile ECT, you will need to install:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Apache Ant (known to work with version 1.6.0)</li>
  <li>Java 2 SDK (known to work with versions 1.4.2 and 1.5)</li>
</ul>
For the physical configuration manager you will also need to install:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Java Web-Services Developer Pack (for JAXB) (known to work with
version 1.5)</li>
</ul>
<p>
Open a commmand shell and set your environment for using Ant and
Java, e.g. set ANT_HOME to the directory in which ant is installed, set
JAVA_HOME to the directory in which java is install and set PATH to
include the /bin subdirectories of each. In some cases you may need to
overrider the default CLASSPATH, e.g. with just ".". For example:<br>
</p>
<pre>set ANT_HOME=C:\ant\apache-ant-1.6.0<br>set JAVA_HOME=C:\j2sdk1.4.2_08<br>set PATH=%ANT_HOME%\bin;%JAVA_HOME%\bin;%PATH%<br>set CLASSPATH=.<br></pre>

<p>To build from source, move to the 
<span style="font-family: monospace;">ect/java</span>
sudirectory and run ant using the command line
</p>
<pre>&gt; <span style="font-weight: bold;">ant</span><br></pre>
<p>This should create a webstart installation in the <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">webstart </span>directory, and
individual scripts and resources for independent use in the <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">install </span>directory.<br>
</p>
<p>
<h3><a name="running">Running ECT</h3>
<P>
See other documentation for more details on how to run ECT, but to 
quickly get started in running the graph editor, move to the
<span style="font-family: monospace;">webstart</span>
directory and, on a Windows machine, run the runwebstart.bat batch fil
using command line
<pre>&gt; <span style="font-weight: bold;">runwebstart</span><br></pre>
</P>
<P>
Scripts also exist in this directory for unix machines.
