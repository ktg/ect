<h3><a name="intro">Introduction</h3>
<P>
This document gives additional details about developing
new ECT components that were not included 
in the simple 
<a href="how_to_add_a_new_component.html">Developing new
components for ECT</a> document, which you should read first.
</p>

<h3><a name="creation">Component creation</h3>
All components must have a public no-args constructor, which will be used to
create instances. This should leave the component in a usable state.

<h3><a name="destruction">Component destruction</h3>
<p>If the component makes use of resources that need to be released (e.g.
if it has opened a window or is controlling a COM port), 
then it must implement a method with signature 
<tt>public void stop()</tt> which will
be called by the ECT system when the component needs to be  
destroyed for some reason
(eg a user has requested the destruction of a component, or ECT is
being shutdown)

<h3><a name="lifecycle">Components with two-stage lifecycles</h3>
<P>
When writing components to control physical devices, it is
common for these components to have a two-stage lifecycle
<ul>
<li>stage one: establish a connection with the device
<li>stage two: control the device once connected
</ul>
If this is the case for your component, then any properties
associated with gathering configuration to perform
stage one should have names starting
with the string <i>config</i> (eg <i>configPortNumber</i>),
and should provide a boolean-typed property called
<i>configured</i> which a user should set to 
<tt>true</tt> to indicate that they have provided
sufficient configuration for the component to attempt
to establish a connection.
This is because ECT can save and recreate component states
to a file, and when recreating such states, it has to 
know if some property values should be recreated first
in order to trigger a reconnection to a device.
</p>
<P>
See <tt>equip.ect.components.phidgets.PhidgetInterfaceKit</tt>
for an example of a component that has a two-stage lifecycle.
</p>

<h3><a name="aware">ECT-aware components</h3>
<p>If a component wishes to interact directly with ECT or the
installation dataspace, or to be aware of property link requests
applied to it, then it can implement the interface 
<tt>equip.ect.IActiveComponent</tt>.
When created the initialise method will be calling, giving the
component a reference to the container installation dataspace client
and the container manager.<br>
</p>
<p>Additional methods are also called when the component is linked to
or is about to be updated because of a link. This is used e.g. in the
dictionaryarraymerge component to merge incoming values (this may
become default behaviour for array-type properties in the future).<br>
</p>

<h3><a name="properties">Available datatypes for properties</h3>

<P>
The available datatypes for a component property are
constrained. In particular, you can use:
<ul>
<li>any java primitive type (boolean, char, byte, short, int, long, double,float and String)
<li>any java boxing type for primitives  - eg 
java.lang.Boolean, java.lang.Character, java.lang.Short etc)
<li>any type extending equip.runtime.ValueBase (eg BooleanBoxImpl, StringBoxImpl, DictionaryImpl)
<li>1D or 2D arrays of any of these types 
</ul>
It should be noted that DictionaryImpl is similar to a hashtable,
(eg it stores a set of key->value mappings) and can 
be used to construct a structured data value. See 
<tt>equip.ect.components.email.EmailReceiver</tt> 
</p>

<h3><a name="developing">Developing factory components</h3>

<P>
It is possible to develop ECT components that can construct and destroy
other components. These are referred to as factory components,
and the components that they create are referred to as 
subcomponents. Factory components
might be useful if you wish to be able to 
 automatically  construct a component to interface to
a particular hardware device when your system detects that such a device
has just been plugged in (eg create new web-cam component when new
web-cam is plugged into a system).
</p>
<P>
To see an example of a factory component, take a look
at source files in package
<tt>equip.ect.components.subcomponenttest</tt> 
</p>

<h3><a name="dynamic">Dynamic Properties</h3>
<p>
In some situations, it may be necessary to develop a component
that can have a varying number of properties. For example, on connection
to a device with multiple physical ports, a component might construct
one property to represent each port. To do this in ECT, you 
should develop a component implementing the 
<tt>equip.ect.DynamicProperties</tt> interface, perhaps making
use of the <tt>equip.ect.DynamicPropertiesSupport</tt> class. This
interface provides you with methods to dynamically add and remove
properties of all types. See the
<tt>equip.ect.components.dynamicbsh.DynamicBeanShell</tt> component
for an example of a component making use of dynamic properties.
