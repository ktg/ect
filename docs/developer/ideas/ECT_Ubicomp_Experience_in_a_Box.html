<h1>ECT Ubicomp Experience in a Box (tm)</h1>
Chris Greenhalgh, 2005-09-14<br>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Still following the thread with physical configuration, but trying
to look a bit broader/at a slant, by asking how we could technically
support the packaging, distribution and (locally-tailored)
deployment/replication of ubicomp experiences...<br>
</p>
<p>In EQUATOR we have talked about the "EQUATOR Starter Kit" and
similar ideas - a literal box of stuff that you might order from (say)
Amazon, to get you started with building and giving EQUATOR-style
Ubicomp Experiences. What would be in such a box? How would it work?
How would you extend it? and so on...<br>
</p>
<h3>Example Scenario/Thought Experiment</h3>
<p>As a starting point we might imagine that the box contains:<br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>A small infrastructure box (a "server", incorporating
infrastructure wireless communications facility);</li>
  <li>A bag of sensors, actuators and displays;</li>
  <li>A bag of batteries and a recharger :-) <br>
  </li>
  <li>A bag of tags (RFID, barcode, etc.), labels, ties, etc.;<br>
  </li>
  <li>A mobile wearable or handheld device (and/or a "starter kit" (CF
card?!) for your phone/PDA);</li>
  <li>A handheld ubicomp multimeter/universal tool and/or a CDROM-based
starter application for your PC;</li>
  <li>A "getting started" DVD;</li>
  <li>A 1-page "quick start" guide.</li>
</ul>
<p>The quick-start guide explains how to turn on the ubimeter (or PC
starter application). The ubimeter suggests you start with a level 1
(easy) experience; you choose from the list "phicon-controlled room
lighting"...<br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>It shows you how to plug in and turn on the infrastructure box.</li>
  <li>The ubimeter detects/discoveres this as it comes online and
giudes you through establishing the trust relationship between the
ubimeter and the server if not preconfigured (e.g. physical docking
and/or synchronized actions and/or user entry of (say) visible keys).</li>
  <li>The ubimeter talks you through connecting the X10 controller and
the Phidget RFID reader to the infrastructure box.</li>
  <li>The ubimeter helps you to identify an X10 lamp/appliance module,
and helps you to allocate a suitable house and device ID to it. </li>
  <li>The ubimeter talks you through inserting the module to control
one of your lamps, and asks you to identify (name and/or photograph)
the lamp associated with that module.</li>
  <ul>
    <li>The ubimeter stores the association between that lamp and the
X10 ID.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>The ubimeter allows you to add X10 controllers to more lamps.</li>
  <li>The ubimeter asks you to choose a couple of small artefacts (e.g.
non-precious ornaments) to become phicons.</li>
  <li>The ubimeter asks you to attach an RFID tag to the first artefact
and then place it on the reader; it asks you identify the artefact by
name and/or by taking a photo of it with the ubimeter's built-in camera.</li>
  <ul>
    <li>The ubimeter stores the association between that artefact and
the read RFID tag value.</li>
    <li>Alternatively, the kit may come with some artefacts with
integrated RFIDs, which are already configured.<br>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <li>The ubimeter allows you to enroll more phicons.</li>
  <li>Whenever a phicon is on the reader the ubimeter gives you the
option of the configuring the lighting associated with that phicon:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>it gives you a list of the known lamps (your own names and/or
images), and their state/brightness, and allows you to change it.</li>
    <li>you can also undo any changes.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>The ubimeter allows you to archive the whole arrangement, and
selectively discard elements of it <br>
  </li>
  <ul>
    <li>such as the mapping between phicons and lighting settings, or
the presence and/or associations of X10 modules and /or RFID tags.</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
Extension 1:<br>
<ul>
  <li>You select the ubimeter option "Ubicomp-enable my phone"</li>
  <li>The ubimeter installs (talks you through installing) an ECT
MIDlet on your phone</li>
  <ul>
    <li>and gathers various information about your phone's capabilities
(e.g. bluetooth)</li>
    <li>and establishes the trust relationship with the phone<br>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <li>You now select the experience extension "Remote control with
&lt;my phone&gt;".</li>
  <li>The ubimeter helps you to check bluetooth is enabled on your
phone and the ECT MIDlet is running.</li>
  <li>The ubimeter pushes the necessary configuration to the phone
MIDlet.</li>
  <li>The user selects the experience trigger option "when i am in
range".</li>
  <li>The ECT MIDlet now checks periodically if it is range of the
installation, and when it is - assuming the relevant experience is
actuve - offers the user access to a GUI to check the current phicon
and modify the light levels for the current phicon.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
Variant 2:<br>
<ul>
  <li>A friend visits who has their own installation. They have written
a "disco" extension which is on their phone.</li>
  <li>When they walk into my house my ubimeter offers me the option of
allowing them to exchange information. I allow this.</li>
  <li>Their disco extension determines that it is compability with my
current installation, and offers an option to activate it.</li>
  <li>My friend activates it.</li>
  <li>My ubimeter asks me to confirm if I will allow it to interface to
my installation; I confirm.</li>
  <li>The light flash in time to my friend's MP3 (well not very in time
with X10 :-)</li>
</ul>
Variant 3:<br>
<ul>
  <li>My friend visits again with their Ubicomp-enabled phone.</li>
  <li>I have now configured my system to recommend mood music
associated with each phicon.</li>
  <li>When my friend is in range, their phone asks if they want to
receive music recommendations from my installation; the accept.</li>
  <li>Suitable music is suggested to my friends phone, which it plays <br>
  </li>
  <ul>
    <li>some of it is already on the phone; some is streamed from my
installation; some is bought by him when it is recommended<br>
    </li>
  </ul>
</ul>
Comments:<br>
<ul>
  <li>can i test/simulate it?</li>
  <li>how do i author "content" for it?</li>
  <li>the ubimeter embodies the locus of control/management, all be it
from outside the experience "run-time". Is this a good real strategy?
[its a bit like the hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy :o) ]</li>
  <li>some negotiation/coordination is at the level of "experiences"
(like "phicon-based lighting-control"); other is lower level (?) (e.g.
"X10 devices present", or "suggested stream")<br>
  </li>
</ul>
