<h1>ECT "semantics" scenario</h1>
Chris Greenhalgh, 2005-07-05 (last updated 2005-07-20)<br>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>ECT currently focusses on sharing (views of) the software component
"layer", comprising distributed components and their properties. The
relationships between this and the physical environment are not
explicit and can be hard to discern, or entirely absent from the set of
digital information captured and made available (e.g. in a replay for
analysis situation).<br>
</p>
<p>This note seeks to suggest a simple, concrete motivating example for
making explicit and making use of additional information within ECT
linking this component-and-property view to the physical devices,
components, settings, etc. in which the system is used. This is
essentially a continuation of the "sematics"/ontology explorations
previously started.<br>
</p>
<p>I have divided this into two separate documents:<br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="ECT_semantics_physical_configuration.html">ECT_semantics_physical_configuration.html</a>
which is where I started this time, looking at modelling the physical
components and context of the system to support assembly, configuration
and understanding of the components and what they connect to.</li>
  <li><a href="ECT_semantics_content_and_interation.html">ECT_semantics_content_and_interation.html</a>
which goes on to consider the extension of the "raw" information in ECT
components and
properties to support the definitions of content and interaction, and
in particular explores the notion of "significance" and its potential
utility/interpretation.</li>
</ul>
