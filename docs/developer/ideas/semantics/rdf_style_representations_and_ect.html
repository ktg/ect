<h1>Simple RDF/Knowledge-style Representations of ECT State/History</h1>
Chris Greenhalgh, 2005-06-28<br>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>For quite some time - e.g. in and around the EQUATOR Curious Home -
we have been interested in representing and reasoning over the state of
the world as apprehended by ECT. See, for example, the <a
 href="curious-home-design-sketch-1-20040331.doc">scenario </a>and <a
 href="curious-home-infra-ontology-20040330.doc">ontology </a>notes,
and an initial <a href="curioushome.rdf">RDF ontology</a>. These take
the approach of described the state of the ECT installation (devices,
components, rooms, properties, relationships, etc.) at some "present"
moment. The prototype client application <a
 href="../src/equip/ect/apps/rdfview/Main.java">../src/equip/ect/apps/rdfview/Main.java</a>
is a first exploration of this - using Jena with a placeholder for
using its RETE forward chaining rule engine. This prototype maintains
RDF statements concerning current components, and their properties
(including values), containers and hosts. However, it does not ground
or relate this to any other parts of the proposed ontology (e.g.
devices, rooms, etc.).</p>
<p>This is apparently complemented by (a) exploring issues of
uncertainty and ambiguity in EQUATOR, especially within the "seamful"
game activity, and (b) some attempts to apply more formal methods or
approaches such as process languages to this kind of system.</p>
<p>The soon-to-be-launched EPSRC-funded Semantic Media project and the
recently started ESRC-funded e-social science node at Nottingham also
have an interest in recording, annotating, replaying and analysing
experiences that directly use or are monitored using ubicomp-type
systems. <br>
</p>
<p>These suggest a more explicit representation of time to directly
accomodate history rather than just momentary state.<br>
</p>
<h2>Direction(s)</h2>
<p>An "event" is something with an extent in time, i.e. a beginning and
an end, between which it is "in progress". An event whose end is in our
past "has occurred"; an event whose start is in our future is "yet to
occur".<br>
</p>
<p>A "state" is a (set of) predicate(s) (without side-effects)
evaluated as true at some moment in time. E.g. (logical conjunctions
of) assertions about "observable" "properties" of "entities"/things at
that time (or in the [known?] past of that time).<br>
</p>
<p>An "action" is a kind of event which is "performed by" some (set
of?) entity(s) and has some effect, typically visible in change(s) of
state before and after its occurance.<br>
