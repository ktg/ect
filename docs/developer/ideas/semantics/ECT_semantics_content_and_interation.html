<h1>ECT "semantics" scenario: content, "significance" and
interaction&nbsp;</h1>
Chris Greenhalgh 2005-07-20<br>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This is a sister-document to <a
 href="ECT_semantics_physical_configuration.html">ECT_semantics_physical_configuration.html</a>.<br>
</p>
<p>This document consider the extension of the "raw" information in ECT
components and properties to support the definitions of content and
interaction, and in particular explores the notion of "significance"
and its potential utility/interpretation.<br>
</p>
<p>So... I have been doing some work on ECT, and trying to thing of
suitable demonstration applications, and been struggling mightily to do
so. This may be because ECT is actually not very useful or appropriate.
However I prefer to think at the moment that it is because the software
component/property aspect/view which currently predominates in ECT is
not a good fit for notions of "application" or "content" (although it
is useful at its own particuar "level" in the system).<br>
</p>
<p>Following from the above-mentioned exploration of modelling and
making use of&nbsp; information about the physical organisation of the
system, this note explores a similar extension to more directly model
"content" and "significance" in and around ECT as it currently stands.
This is also responding to reflections on other EQUATOR experiences,
including MacRoom, Augurscope, Unearthing Virtual History, Skipping,
(my perception of) Chawton, POUTs, ...<br>
</p>
<h2>Definitions</h2>
<p>Some initial definitions/explorations:<br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>"Significance" is concerned with both </li>
  <ul>
    <li>significant (to be taken note of)
versus insignificant (to be ignored) and <br>
    </li>
    <li>signification, i.e. what
it stands for or represents.<br>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <li>Behaviour is generally about what the system does.</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Observed behaviour is what it has been seen (or otherwise
observed) to do in particular historical situations/occasions</li>
    <li>Future, specified or programmed behaviour will typically be
expressed in terms of sets of possible behaviours contingent on the
activities/behaviours of other aspects of the "total system", including
users and physical environment.</li>
    <li>The behaviour (or application) will often be specified (or at
least initially envisioned) in terms of the "significant" actions of
users, arrangements of physical artefacts and environment, etc.</li>
    <ul>
      <li>This may or may not be refined or recast in terms of system
elements: sensors, programmed behaviours,&nbsp; actuators, etc. (the
translation may be tacet/implicit)<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  <li>Interaction is about how the system responds to its users</li>
  <ul>
    <li>This is a particular view of behaviour which emphasises action
&amp; response and/or dialog.<br>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <li>Content is about what the users gets (back)</li>
  <ul>
    <li>It is probably expressed as particular families of contingency
and behaviour/response, and may include media elements and other forms
of information which may be "communicated" to user(s).</li>
    <li>It may be authored, i.e. crafted by one or more people with
particular responsibility for this.</li>
    <li>It probably assumes a particular stereotype of
behaviour/interaction. This can be embodied in a software "engine" of
some sort. <br>
    </li>
    <li>It is typically (recursively) divisible into smaller parts,
each of which is typically deemed to be appropriate or applicable only
in certain circumstances or for certain purposes.&nbsp;</li>
    <li>Some forms of content are (taking illustrative examples from a
first-person shooter game :-):</li>
    <ul>
      <li>primarily passive, just for presenting to the user (in some
way), e.g. media assets: geometries, textures, images, text</li>
      <li>organisational, e.g. initial content (monster, trap, etc.)
placement maps<br>
      </li>
      <li>constraints, for users and/or system elements, e.g.
reachability maps, physics (could be treated as behaviour??)<br>
      </li>
      <li>behaviours, to be enacted by elements of the system, e.g.
animations (could be treated as passive?!), traps, attacks, unlocking
remote doors<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
</ul>
<h2>Notes</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The design and construction of the physical elements of the
system is a key activity in itself, which has a major contribution to
the sense and "feel" (the significance?!) of the final system.</li>
  <li>The content/engine disjunction reflects the specialisation of
skills and roles between "content developers" or "artists" and
"programmers", which is analogous to the levels of engagement discussed
with ECT.</li>
  <ul>
    <li>We do not yet have a "content developer" level as such, since
this would be tied to specific components (I guess; or new perspectives
as being explored here); c.f. scripting.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>How general are the stereotypes for interaction/content? Should
one or more be directly supported by the system? If not, how is this
perspective added/integrated?<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Examples of application/behaviour/interaction stereotypes in ubicomp</h2>

<h2>Examples of "significance" and sensing<br>
</h2>
"Significant" action/interaction inferred from sensor readings
(component property values):<br>
<ul>
  <li>Pinger receiver reports pinger ID I (e.g. Ambient Wood,
Mac-to-street, Chawton)</li>
  <ul>
    <li>=&gt; Pinger, hence device (hence person?!) "close to" physical
location where (a) pinger with ID I deployed (at time T)</li>
    <ul>
      <li>=&gt; person (device) "has gone to" physical location(s)
associated with pinger ID I<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  <li>GPS position XYZ (e.g. Unearthing etc.)</li>
  <ul>
    <li>=&gt; GPS received, hence device (hence person?!) "roughly at
lat/long (relative to the earth)" XYZ (at time T)</li>
    <ul>
      <li>=&gt; person "has gone to" XYZ</li>
      <li>=&gt; person "has gone to" significant physical location L
(position ~XYZ)<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  <li>Ultrasonic receiver reports position XYZ (e.g. MacRoom,
CuriousHome?)</li>
  <ul>
    <li>=&gt; Ultrasonic receiver (transmitter) (hence device...) "in
range of" ("close to"?) (particular) transmitter (receiver) array (at
time T)<br>
    </li>
    <li>=&gt; Ultrasonic receiver (transmitter) (hence device...)
"roughtly at offset" XYZ relative to the (particular) transmitter
(receiver) array (at time T)</li>
    <ul>
      <li>=&gt; person "is near to" ("is looking at"?!) exhibit E
(which has location ~XYZ)<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  <li>Bluetooth discovery of MAC address M (e.g. not-so-curious home?)</li>
  <ul>
    <li>=&gt; Bluetooth radio, (hence device (phone, PDA), hence
person??...) "close to" physical location where polling bluetooth radio
deployed (at time T)</li>
  </ul>
  <li>RFID reader reports RFID R (e.g. shape castle, skipping)</li>
  <ul>
    <li>=&gt; RFID tag having ID R hence (particular) physical artefact
"close to" physical location of (particular?) aerial of (particular)
RFID reader</li>
    <ul>
      <li>=&gt; physical artefact (having RFID tag R) "has been placed
on"(?!) physical artefact (housing aerial of RFID reader) (by person
P??)<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  <li>analog input (connected to dial) changes value to V (e.g. audio
chair, shape virtual radio, group proj. game)</li>
  <ul>
    <li>=&gt; someone "manipates" dial to angle A(V)&nbsp;</li>
    <ul>
      <li>small delta-V may be taken to be "noise" (electrical,
mechanical, finger vibration)<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <li>=&gt; someone "selects (e.g.) channel" C (angle ~A) for device
associated with (that) dial.</li>
    <li>=&gt; A&gt;threshold: someone "opens the door" (group proj.
game; analog input corresponds to angle of a door handle)<br>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <li>Load cell array report values ABCD (e.g. weight table, skipping)</li>
  <ul>
    <li>=&gt; device which integrates those load cells (table) "is
carrying weight" ("is subject to force") M(ABCD)</li>
    <li>=&gt; mass (centre of gravity) "roughly at offset" XY(ABCD)
relative to the (particular) load cells/load sensing surface</li>
  </ul>
  <li>digital input (connected to a pressure pad) is true (e.g. audio
chair)<br>
  </li>
  <ul>
    <li>=&gt; something "is on" the physical artefact on/under which
the pressure pad is placed</li>
    <ul>
      <li>=&gt; (e.g.) someone (?!) "is sitting on" the audio chair</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  <li>digital input (connected to a button) becomes true (e.g. shared
lights)</li>
  <ul>
    <li>=&gt; someone "presses" the (particular, e.g. green) button</li>
    <ul>
      <li>someone (e.g.) "(wants to) make brighter" the light
associated with that button<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
</ul>
<p>Note: many "significant" interactions are not sense-able (either in
some particular context, or in general), e.g.<br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>is someone actually "looking at" a particular exhibit (or
device)? <br>
  </li>
  <ul>
    <li>are the "attending to" or "interested in" that particular
exhibit?</li>
    <li>is someone actually "thinking about" something particular<br>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <li>is someone (currently) alone? having a conversation?<br>
  </li>
  <li>is the reading in error for some (external) reason (e.g.
reflections)?</li>
  <li>is someone lost? or having trouble?</li>
  <ul>
    <li>or are they (say) waiting for traffic to pass? or sheltering
from the rain?<br>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <li>is someone near to some thing/place which is much smaller than
the positioning system's resolution or accuracy?</li>
</ul>
Some "significant" things in relation to application stereotypes:<br>

  <li style="font-style: italic;">presentation/filtering of
"contextually relevant" information</li>
  <ul>
    <li>where are you</li>
    <li>what is your (notionally sensable) "context" (e.g. other
people, history of activities)</li>
    <li>what are your interests/other non-sensed "context" (e.g.
appointments, plans)</li>
    <li>what information is available<br>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <li><span style="font-style: italic;">capture of local (esp. physical

    </li>
  </ul>
