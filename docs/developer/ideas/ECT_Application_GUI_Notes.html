<h1>ECT Application GUI Notes</h1>
Chris Greenhalgh 2005-09-01<br>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
Current ECT has a number of system GUIs (e.g. installation manager,
graph editor) but only limited support for application GUIs and their
management. In particular application GUIs can currently be:<br>
<ul>
  <li>a Processing application running from the IDE or converted to a
component;</li>
  <li>a custom component with a (Java) GUI (e.g. message board);</li>
  <li>a custom application using the ECT APIs comparable to the graph
editor (e.g. link editor).</li>
</ul>
<p>While components generated from processing applets expose some
control over window size and position, this is hard to use from within
applications. Consequently, there is effectively no support for
interfaces which might change or be hidden/revealed at different stages
of an experience, or as an installation moves between multiple
experiences.<br>
</p>
<p>The aim of this note is explore and sketch out one or more
approaches to supporting GUIs in ubicomp applications constructed using
ECT in which multiple GUI elements can be combined and managed on
multiple display-capable devices to reflect e.g. stages in an
experience, views on an experience, and multiple co-existing
experiences. <br>
</p>
<p>The main classes of display device considered are:<br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>small embedded displays, including e.g. Phidget text LCD and
displays based on mobile phone screens<br>
  </li>
  <li>mobile phones*</li>
  <li>PDAs*</li>
  <li>tablet and wearable PCs*<br>
  </li>
  <li>larger embedded displays, including those based on tablet PCs and
data projectors, with* and without touchscreen facility</li>
</ul>
<p>* only a subset have standard coupled input; other are display-only
or require some kind of remote input and management of this. For now we
focus on those with standard coupled input.<br>
</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<h3>J2ME MIDlets</h3>
<p>A MIDlet is compabable to an applet, and embodies a single
application for a mobile (e.g. phone) device. Its states are:<br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Paused (including new)</li>
  <li>Active</li>
  <li>Destroyed<br>
  </li>
</ul>
State changes can be initiated by the container or by the MIDlet. <br>
<p>At least on some phones (e.g. my Nokia 6680) the user can switch
between multiple MIDlets without exiting them. The API implies that a
paused MIDlet can ask to make itself Active (may be vetoed by an
exception); presumably this would switch it to the foreground. I don't
know how widely this is supported.<br>
</p>
<p>There is a (slightly) distinct notion of whether a MIDlet's current
Displayable (see below) is currently visible (poll operation). If it is
not, it may be due to it being "in the background" with another MIDlet
"in the foreground" (not known if/how this relates to Paused/Active),
or the system displaying a system screen instead of the Displayable,
e.g. to allow the user to select between Commands or for editing text
on some devices.<br>
</p>
<h3>MIDP UI<br>
</h3>
<p>The J2ME MIDP specification defines a UI model suitable for mobile
phones, with a significant degree of specific-device independence. This
seems like a good starting point, as phones are the most
restricted/restrictive of the main classes of device being considered.<br>
</p>
<p>A phone can display exactly one Displayable at a time. This has:<br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>an option Tickertape (except on full-screen Canvas)<br>
  </li>
  <li>a set of user-selectable Commands</li>
  <li>a main screen area.</li>
</ul>
The main screen area is further specialised as one of the following:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Screen - high-level classes which encapsulate a data/interaction
model, including</li>
  <ul>
    <li>complex (single) user interface components such as List,
TextBox or Alert<br>
    </li>
    <li>Form, which contain a number of UI Items</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Canvas or Graphics - low-level classes giving bit-mapped drawing
capabilities and low-level input<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Each midlet has a Display class which "acts as the display manager
that is instantiated for each active MIDlet and provides<br>
methods to retrieve information about the device&#8217;s display
capabilities." "A Displayable is made visible by calling the
setCurrent() method of Display."<br>
</p>
<p>High-level class callbacks are:<br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>CommandListener commandAction</li>
  <li>ItemListener itemStateChanged</li>
</ul>
Low-level callbacks include various primitive inputs including:<br>
<ul>
  <li>key presses<br>
  </li>
  <li>pointer events (not present on all devices).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Chawton system v.1</h3>
The schools experience at Chawton (mid 2005) uses a card-based
interface metaphore, which combines:<br>
<ul>
  <li>user-driven navigation through available cards</li>
  <li>asynchronous (sensor-driven) presentation of new cards (card
sets).<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Discussion</h2>
<h3>Possible MIDlet-style approach:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Each capable device has a component which represents its
application (~MIDlet)-hosting capability</li>
  <ul>
    <li>? is this actually a MIDlet (or similar) within some larger
framework inaccessible to ECT? Probably</li>
    <li>? is there anything to stop the user exiting it, etc.? Probably
not :-)<br>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <li>An application is represented by a component which can be
connected to the application-hosting component to represent its
availability on that device</li>
  <ul>
    <li>? the user can presumably switch between applications, but can
they also exit them? what about (re)starting them?? i.e. is it like a
capability or an component/instance? it should be a component, so they
can switch between them and pause/unpause, but not destroy <br>
    </li>
    <ul>
      <li>(what about suicidal applications?!)<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <li>? can be user see all (even "paused") applications? what about
applications that they shouldn't have access to at present? do they
have to be disconnected?! Initially, they can see them all</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Some applications can accept fragments of some sort (c.f. chawton
card decks)</li>
  <ul>
    <li>? is this a general model (Drawables), or application specific?
if general, what about navigation and accessibility management?</li>
    <ul>
      <li>extra commands added automatically?! index pages?! data
(graph) descriptions of permitted navigational structures?</li>
      <li>could be Drawable[] local interface</li>
      <li>in that case, is multiple applications (above) really just
the same?!</li>
      <li>perhaps it can be keyed to "application state" (whatever that
means - see below)<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
</ul>
Other Questions:<br>
<ul>
  <li>what are the trade-offs between modifying Screens (e.g. Forms)
and switching between a more static set?</li>
</ul>
<h3>Application and Interaction "State"</h3>
<h4>Example 1: Hitchers</h4>
<p>Consider Hitchers, for example...<br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>In some places the Drawables represent hierarchical navigation of
available options, e.g. Search. <br>
  </li>
  <ul>
    <li>Availability depends on:<br>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <ul>
      <li>state - can only drop what you have a hitcher, only search
when you don't</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Transition depends on:</li>
    <ul>
      <li>user choice among next options</li>
      <li>? asynchronous changes (not it hitchers)<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  <li>In some places the Drawables represent stages in a (potentially
branching) process of (here) user input, e.g. Summon. <br>
  </li>
  <ul>
    <li>Availability depends on:</li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <ul>
      <li>completion of prior stages</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Transition depends on:</li>
    <ul>
      <li>user input and explicit choice</li>
      <li>? asynchronous changes (not it hitchers)<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  <li>In some places the Drawable represents blocking for extended
"internal" operations, e.g. contact server. <br>
  </li>
  <ul>
    <li>Availability:</li>
    <ul>
      <li>application is performing that action/process</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Transition:</li>
    <ul>
      <li>process completes successfully, or fails</li>
      <li>(optional) process is aborted (or orphaned) by the user<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
</ul>
Hitcher state changes are all synchronous with user interaction
(through user initiation plus blocking if necessary). State is a
combination of:<br>
<ul>
  <li>significant internal state (whether you have a hitcher)</li>
  <li>user choices between options (drop vs answer)</li>
  <li>stages in sequential activities (stages of summoning)</li>
</ul>
Note also:<br>
<ul>
  <li>although Displayables are reused, data fields are populated with
"current" data before re/display (e.g. hitcher name, hitcher image)</li>
  <ul>
    <li>typically the callback which navigates to it will do this
before making it current!</li>
    <li>but perhaps that is just an implementation detail of an active
"status" display <br>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <li>forms serve to elicit structured user input; this must be wanted,
and should go somewhere!</li>
  <ul>
    <li>is it a component with corresponding properties?!<br>
    </li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<h4>Example 2: Chawton</h4>
Two asynchronous events:<br>
<ul>
  <li>receiving a new set of cards (triggered by location change)</li>
  <ul>
    <li>makes the new set available</li>
    <li>pops the head of the new set to be current<br>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <li>timed transition (not before or always after)</li>
  <ul>
    <li>? not sure if it prevents going to next for time, or forces
next after time or both<br>
    </li>
  </ul>
</ul>
Explicit user actions (not entirely sure as I haven't seen the
application, but...):<br>
<ul>
  <li>push button option to record an audio sample</li>
  <ul>
    <li>creates a new card!<br>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <li>explicit "next" within an ordered list of cards</li>
  <li>some kind of index?! (implied by description of experience)<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>General</h2>
The Display schedules Displayables.<br>
But it is a bit more complicated than that :-)<br>
