<h1>ECT Complex Component Interaction Ideas</h1>
Chris Greenhalgh 2005-07-28<br>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
Reflecting on the uses (and non-uses) of ECT I have identified the
limited forms of component interaction to be a key limitation: at
present interaction is (almost*) only through direct linking of
component properties, so that changing values of a source property are
set as the values of a destination property. The range of types
supported is also currently limited to strings and (for most purposes)
1D arrays. This has a number of limitations:<br>
<ul>
  <li>although events can be modelling in this way, it is not ideal: <br>
  </li>
  <ul>
    <li>events often have complex types which are not handled at
present;<br>
    </li>
    <li>modelling events as properties can result in a second event
with the same value being suppressed (e.g. by the standard Java
property change support).</li>
  </ul>
  <li>the editor support is quite limited:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>there are no type-specific value editors/display: everything is
coerced to/from Strings in the current editors;</li>
  </ul>
  <li>there is no explicit support for compound values, e.g. tables
with insert/update/delete</li>
  <li>context information is effectively lost because just the value is
propagated along a property link</li>
  <ul>
    <li>property values are often implicitly contextualised by the
component of which they are part (e.g. that two numbers are actually
the lat/long of a particular GPS receiver) - this is lost by the link's
simple copy operation;<br>
    </li>
    <li>property values are currently constrained to be simple, so it
is not even possible to communicate values that incorporate context in
an obvious form.<br>
    </li>
  </ul>
</ul>
*almost: there is support for linking interface-valued properties
between local components so that the target component can directly
invoke operations on the interface made available by the source
component. However:<br>
<ul>
  <li>there is no support for managing or monitoring these invocations;</li>
  <li>it does not work between containers;</li>
  <li>it is rather unclear in the Graph Editor and similar views.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Proposal(s)</h2>
So...:<br>
<ul>
  <li>add support for complex types (e.g. beans; maps) based on
introspection to translate to/from Dictionary type.</li>
  <li>add support for event producers (in java, components with
addXListener/removeXListener methods) and event consumers (in java,
components which implement XListener interfaces or have properties
whose values have type or implement XListener), mapping Bean events to
EQUIP events. Requires new EventPublisher, EventConsumer and
EventLinkRequest tuple types and an ComponentEvent event type, plus
support in the Container(s) and Editor(s), (or overloading the meaning
of ComponentProperty and PropertyLinkRequest; the source
pseudo-property value would have to distinguishable as an event source).<br>
  </li>
  <li>add support for type matching in the editor, e.g. event source
-&gt; consumer, including event type; local interface property type;
"sensible" property value coercions.</li>
  <li>add support for blackboard-style linking, where some components
can assert sets of values, while other can retrieve/monitor values
matching patterns of interest</li>
</ul>
<h3>Blackboard Linking</h3>
This is not so different from merge links, which would populate an
array with the union of the source values. But...<br>
<ul>
  <li>that would not allow filtering, i.e. management or selectivity of
replication (unless there were an intermediate component)</li>
  <li>that would not allow incremental changes to values as far as
components are concerned - the entire composite value would have to be
communicated and notified</li>
  <li>that would not allow direct use of dataspace mechanisms?!
(efficiency, again, I think)<br>
  </li>
</ul>
In the blackboard model, various non-blackboard type could be linked to
it:<br>
<ul>
  <ul>
    <li>a simple property connected to a blackboard is reflected as an
item</li>
    <li>an array-valued property is reflected as a number of items(?)</li>
    <li>a bag-model-valued property is reflected as number of items</li>
    <ul>
      <li>a bag model is a posited active collection with membership
change events (bag? set? list?)</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
</ul>
example:<br>
<ul>
  <li>C1:P1 ---&gt; Bag1 ---&gt; C2:P2</li>
  <ul>
    <li>so a Bag is kind of like a component (but is really just a
dataspace - or part of a dataspace, running on some machine); it
probably only has one "component"<br>
    </li>
    <li>a default link does no special filtering or mapping</li>
    <li>a link from a property to a Bag must be handled by the source
component's container, which must maintain appropriate data items in
the dataspace corresponding to the Bag</li>
    <li>a link to a property from a Bag (or possibly also a link
direct to a bag-model property) causes the target component's container
to monitor the corresponding dataspace (or establish its own dataspace)
and update the Bag model accordingly</li>
    <li>a link to a property from a Bag may be annotated with a
filter which will constrain that is requested/replicated</li>
    <li>a link from a property to a Bag might(??) be annotated with
extra value-wrapping/mapping information, and correspondingly a link to
a property from a Bag might be annotated with extra
value-unwrapping/mapping information</li>
    <ul>
    </ul>
  </ul>
</ul>
Could prototype as:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Dataspace server component</li>
  <ul>
    <li>IDataspace interface property (readonly)<br>
    </li>
    <li>Dataspace URL ? (readonly)</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Dataspace client component</li>
  <ul>
    <li>IDataspace interface property (readonly)<br>
    </li>
    <li>Dataspace URL ? (linked from server) <br>
    </li>
  </ul>
</ul>
Components explicitly use IDataspace interface. But:<br>
<ul>
  <li>have to use the right server/client component for each container<br>
  </li>
  <li>components have to use the dataspace API directly<br>
  </li>
</ul>
Could prototype as:
<ul>
  <ul>
    <li>BagServer component</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Bag URL (readonly)<br>
      </li>
      <li>Bag API (readonly)<br>
      </li>
      <ul>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <li>BagClient component</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Bag URL (link from BagServer)</li>
      <li>Bag (client) API (readonly)</li>
      <ul>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <li>PropertyToBag component</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Bag API (link from BagServer/BagClient)</li>
      <li>value (singleton or array)<br>
      </li>
      <ul>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <li>BagToProperty component [Note: loses incremental change
update(s)]<br>
    </li>
    <ul>
      <li>Bag API (link from BagServer/BagClient)</li>
      <li>template (Dictionary?)<br>
      </li>
      <li>value (readonly) (array)</li>
      <ul>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <li>[you have to make a lot of components, and make sure you get
them in the right places, and you get the extra levels of indirection
via property change handling]</li>
    <li>[otherwise the containers need to distinguish Bag links
(preferred) and/or Bag "properties"]</li>
    <li>[what about persistence, configurations, etc.?]<br>
    </li>
    <ul>
    </ul>
  </ul>
</ul>
(rename to "Blackboard")<br>
Design choices:<br>
<ul>
  <li>how to map ordinary values to the blackboard</li>
  <ul>
    <li>single -&gt; item</li>
    <li>array -&gt; item per element</li>
    <li>technical mechanism...?</li>
    <ul>
      <li>adaptor items</li>
      <ul>
        <li>? simple but more messy &amp; complicated</li>
      </ul>
      <li>custom support in containers</li>
      <ul>
        <li>is this specific to this, or to all (say) remote
interfaces??</li>
        <ul>
          <li>specific so far: "coercing" an interface to a value (or a
value to an interface)</li>
        </ul>
        <li>ordinary -&gt; blackboard</li>
        <ul>
          <li>? link from property -&gt; blackboard import property</li>
          <ul>
            <li>=&gt; access to source/link information within
(possibly custom) target setter</li>
          </ul>
          <li>? link from remote blackboard interface to property</li>
          <ul>
            <li>? how do you know it is an input or an output</li>
            <li>custom handling by container, e.g. based on
interface(s) supported by stub<br>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </ul>
      </ul>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  <li>having a distinct blackboard component or just having links
between properties</li>
  <li>how it is located (what machine)</li>
  <ul>
    <li>=&gt; a distinct component<br>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <li>how it is configured <br>
  </li>
  <ul>
    <li>=&gt; (optional) configuration properties<br>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <li>whether it is a separate DS or shared</li>
  <ul>
    <li>cope with installation partition/mobile elements</li>
    <ul>
      <li>=&gt; might be shared (internally) but only on a server per
container/host basis</li>
    </ul>
    <li>installation DS??</li>
    <ul>
      <li>=&gt; could be for that host/container?!</li>
    </ul>
    <li>configurable persistence?!</li>
    <ul>
      <li>=&gt; at least per-configuration dataspaces per host</li>
    </ul>
    <li>efficient/light-weight</li>
    <ul>
      <li>=&gt; either shared, or DS re-engineered to share underlying
stuff (e.g. connections)</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  <li>how links are realised</li>
  <ul>
    <li>local interface?</li>
    <ul>
      <li>=&gt; NO - would require explicit client per container</li>
    </ul>
    <li>remote interface?</li>
    <ul>
      <li>=&gt; only if it is a service-specific proxy, not a generic
RMI proxy (c.f. java.rmi.Remote vs Serializable)</li>
      <ul>
        <li>publisher links will go the "wrong" way (unless direction
is a cosmetic editor feature)</li>
        <li>want value not set by persistence recovery, and unset by
link removal (like local interfaces)</li>
        <li>inter-language issues?! (can't use Java Serialization of
the stub object, or java bytecode with C#)</li>
        <ul>
          <li>may not have multi-language/platform version</li>
          <ul>
            <li>=&gt; need option of code loading</li>
            <ul>
              <li>=&gt; container HTTP server for code serving? or is
it loaded from the capability jar?<br>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </ul>
          <li>may have...</li>
          <ul>
            <li>=&gt; need multi-platform options, tagged</li>
          </ul>
        </ul>
        <li>setting (at target) requires careful handling, e.g. to copy
over values from previous, or other way to allow component to be
written and execute without being adversely affected but
setting/unsetting</li>
        <ul>
          <li>=&gt; component's view is locally distinct from stub?!</li>
          <ul>
            <li>distinct in internal implementation, or in
container/component separation??<br>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </ul>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <li>magic value hack (c.f. local interface)</li>
    <ul>
      <li>=&gt; not ideal - more custom case handling<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  <li>how to map the blackboard to ordinary types</li>
  <li>what blackboard-specific type/interface to have for aware
components</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Options</li>
    <ul>
      <li>IDataspace</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>Simpler Dataspace API??</li>
      <li>non-GUID API (i.e. no item update?), e.g. SetModel</li>
      <ul>
        <li>=&gt; good for fact and reasoning-type applications<br>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <li>issues</li>
    <ul>
      <li>GUIDs?</li>
      <li>needs events</li>
      <li>incremental changes<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  <li>is subscriber filtering supported? how?</li>
  <ul>
    <li>link attribute</li>
    <ul>
      <li>? more complicated - new link type/attribute; new editor
facility (link interaction)<br>
      </li>
      <li>more visible/declarative<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <li>via API from aware components only</li>
    <ul>
      <li>less visible/declarative<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <li>blackboard dynamic attribute</li>
  </ul>
  <li>how/whether to distinguish publishers and subscribers</li>
  <ul>
    <li>link direction</li>
    <li>distinct dataspace properties</li>
    <li>not at all<br>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <li>what access to blackboard contents from other applications, esp.
editor</li>
  <ul>
    <li>could host the remote interface itself?!</li>
    <li>and/or load helper "property editor" from the (same?!)
capability jar<br>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <li>authorable (persistent) values in it?</li>
  <ul>
    <li>could depend on editor (above)<br>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <li>how is persistent recovery supported</li>
  <li>how are transferable configurations supported</li>
  <li>how is logging/recording supported<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Alternative(s)</h3>
What about a more general connector framework? (c.f. control plane vs
data plane)<br>
<ul>
  <li>attributes of link request may identify/configure connector</li>
  <ul>
    <li>e.g. reliability, flow control, protocol, logging?,
visibility?, intermediaries<br>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <li>editor is effectively creating connectors to itself from all
visible properties in order to show then</li>
  <li>property values move to separate dataitems</li>
  <li>property values are not published by default (or not all...?!)</li>
  <li>properties become "connection points"</li>
  <li>connection points have various general type characteristics</li>
  <ul>
    <li>in, out, inout</li>
    <li>1:1, 1:n, n:1</li>
    <li>event, static/changing value, static/changing set, invocations</li>
    <li>data type(s)</li>
  </ul>
  <li>connection points have particular realisation in the component</li>
  <ul>
    <li>eventing property (has get method)<br>
    </li>
    <li>writable property (has set method)<br>
    </li>
    <li>event publisher/registration (has addXListener method)<br>
    </li>
    <li>event listener interface (implements XListener, or property
with get and not set method has type XListener)<br>
    </li>
    <li>supported interface (implement I, or property with get and not
set method has type I)<br>
    </li>
    <li>individual method&nbsp; (via interface?)<br>
    </li>
    <li>required interface (property with set method has type I)<br>
    </li>
    <li>explicit framework connection point (property with get method
has type ConnectionPoint)<br>
    </li>
    <li>network protocol end point (via explicit framework?)<br>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <li>various adaptors and coercions may be available</li>
  <li>connection points may have configurable logging/dataspace export</li>
</ul>
What might this mean for dataspace-style interaction??<br>
<ul>
  <li>there is a (say) dataspace type connection point</li>
  <li>a connection between two dataspaces is a replication request
(c.f. City):</li>
  <ul>
    <li>the (say) destination creates a client for the source, inserts
a suitable template pattern, and copies matches over into the
destination</li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <ul>
      <li>? is the destination/source does copy choice artibrary?</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <ul>
        <li>keep control at destination?? e.g. local value mapping??</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <li>why not dataspace client/server connection points?</li>
    <ul>
      <li>doesn't show dataflow direction (does that matter?)</li>
      <li>doesn't support 1:n on client</li>
      <li>? can client use DS proxy interleaved with setting DS URL,
activation, etc.?</li>
      <ul>
        <li>depends on whether configuring client and server, or
dynamically creating server proxy?!<br>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  <li>a connection with a dataspace connector on only one end inserts a
whatever-to-dataspace (or dataspace-to-whatever) adapter on one end or
the other</li>
  <ul>
    <li>? is the adapt close to/far from dataspace choice arbitrary?</li>
    <ul>
      <li>no. but how to choose...? depends if far end knows how to
adapt, and/or if near end knows how to adapt?</li>
      <li>given DS/DS copying, better to do at destination?!</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
</ul>
<h2>example scenario?!</h2>
Simplified macroom/chawton-type system:<br>
<ul>
  <li>GPS position is captured</li>
  <li>classified into &gt;=0 semantic locations predefined by GPS
position(s)</li>
  <li>triggers presentation of predefined "content" keyed to that
location</li>
  <li>run on a PDA/laptop, without networking (in the first instance?!)</li>
</ul>
Components etc<br>
<ul>
  <li>GPS device driver</li>
  <ul>
    <li>COM port config property</li>
    <li>configured property</li>
    <li>Lat/long output (say)</li>
    <ul>
      <li>passed through annotator component which outputs:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>User U1 at Latitude lat and Longitude long</li>
        <ul>
          <li>into...<br>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  <li>Local user context space</li>
  <li>Location definition space</li>
  <ul>
    <li>containing definitions</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Location L1 is lat1-lat2 by long1-long2<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  <li>Location Mapper component</li>
  <ul>
    <li>reads locations (Y) from location definition space</li>
    <li>reads user (X) positions from local user context space</li>
    <li>when user position is in location, assert back to context space:<br>
    </li>
    <ul>
      <li>User X at Location Y</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  <li>Content definition space</li>
  <li>Content mapper component</li>
  <ul>
    <li>reads user (X) locations from local user context space</li>
    <li>reads content (C) from content definition space</li>
    <li>when user location matches content location anntation, assert
back to context space</li>
    <ul>
      <li>User X should have content C</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  <li>Content display component</li>
  <ul>
    <li>reads user content assertions from context space</li>
    <li>displays current content (if any)<br>
    </li>
  </ul>
</ul>
Note that various spaces might be linked to/from other spaces to
support distribution.<br>
<ul>
  <li>so a link from a dataspace may be filtering.</li>
  <li>connecting two dataspaces must be possible; but could be an
explicit bridge component.</li>
  <li>it doesn't seem disasterous if a client can only be 1-connected
(since it could be connected to a server which it turn is connected to
multiple other servers via the above mechanism)<br>
  </li>
</ul>
