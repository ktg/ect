  <li><span style="font-style: italic;">C </span>needed for RCA
curious home explorations (also implies <span
 style="font-style: italic;">W</span>)<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Documentation</h2>
<ul>
  <li>All source files need javadoc formatted comments (present in some
already).</li>
  <li>Tutorial docs?</li>
  <li>etc. :-)<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Release</h2>
<ul>
  <li><span style="font-style: italic;">W</span> Canonical set of core
components [kind of]<br>

arrangement [getting there - tar &amp; sxi tutorials/intro/scenarios]<br>
  </li>
  <li>Wiki [not done], mailing list [done] and/or similar community
support for sharing
arrangements, components, etc.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Licencing</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Choose open source licence</li>
  <li>Release on that licence</li>
  <ul>
    <li>track/prune non-licencable elements<br>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <li>SourceForge?!<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Infrastructure</h2>
<h3>Bugs</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Per-component persistence...does not atomically transition from
one backup to another, i.e. there
is a period of time during the writing of persistence files in which a
container or host failure will leave an unreadable (typically
truncated, i.e. partially written) persistence file.</li>
  <li>It is still a VERY BAD THING to cross-link component properties
and then re-activate them all at once, e.g. from persistence recovery.
Probably unavoidable deadlock possibilities. Could consider making
property add events (as well as updates) queued.</li>
  <li>Web start container hard-coded hack to only be able to start java
container.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Desirable features</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Standard recording facility (?extension to configuration
management?) for (a) dataspace state and events [=File backed dataspace
logs!] (b) internal component
state and events (c) media (e.g. captured video frames, audio packets).</li>
  <li>Extensible framework for coercion to target property type on set
for non-primitive types, e.g. URL or image to float, etc.</li>
  <li>It should be possible to mark some properties as being propagated
as <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">non</span>-mandatory
[note - discovered that all updates are currently unreliable by default
- beware - 2004-07-13 cmg] updates in EQUIP, specifically those which
may change
very rapidly and for which intermediate values may be missed without
problems. <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">This should
improve the responsiveness and resilience of the
system under load. Suggestion: use custom extension of Bean Property
Info descriptor.</span> Non-mandatory events which change rapidly will
lose intermediate values, e.g. triggers! beware!<br>
  </li>
  <li><span style="font-style: italic;"></span>WebStart version <br>
  </li>
  <ul>
    <li>should show allow installation auto-start to be
configured.</li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li>should run automatically as a service (Windows)
or equivalent.</li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li>...on
stop container or installation... containers should do persistence
at this point.</li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li>should allow dataspace master a clean shutdown
(to flush persistence) on installation terminate.</li>
    <li>(ComponentExporter) should create new component instance(s) in
a separate thread (remember to resync &amp; check that request still
exists once successfully created and before actually exporting).</li>
    <li>should have an extra&nbsp; persistence indication mechanism to
ensure short-lived components are still persisted <br>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <li>Something like configurations but transferable between
installations, i.e. templates.</li>
  <li>Allow a partially configured component to be exposed as a
capability (e.g. SimpleVideoProcessor with particular config).</li>
  <li>Move processing import facility to a separate tool, or...<br>
  </li>
  <ul>
    <li>[after Processing support v.1] support Processing jars directly
as a
component type in ExporterGUI/Container.<br>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <li><span style="font-style: italic;">C?</span> Timeview can't cope
with high update rates, i think (was trying a simple video network and
the whole system bogged down).</li>
  <li>Container GUI: <br>
  </li>
  <ul>
    <li>add label, e.g 'Capabilities'<br>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <li>Host manager GUI:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>reorder tabs: new -&gt; dicovered -&gt; known</li>
    <li>add restart with download updates options</li>
    <li>'secure' export of secret, e.g. via memory stick?!<br>
    </li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<h2>Tools</h2>
<ul>
  <li>(more) New browser(s) and configuration tools that are pretty and
easy
to use.</li>
  <li>Easy link from component browser to web browser [improved through
set value and copy]</li>
  <li>Structure running components to show parent/child hierarchy</li>
  <li><span style="font-style: italic;">C </span>Timeview version to
work on File backed data store logs.</li>
  <li>Dataspace browser
does not terminate on close (but consider embedded use with
DataManager).</li>
  <li>Log overview/directory/browser ...--&gt;?? replay tool <br>
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
</ul>
<h2>Current Component Issues</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Bar Code 1D reader is pretty useless in its current form. Does
not read reliably or consistently.</li>
  <li>Component ...X... does not stop. [insert component name] EZIO?<br>
  </li>
  <li>Nice if video framework image URLs allowed click to give position
in image coordinates for use in Region processor.</li>
  <li>ARToolkit video component missing important outputs - confidence,
image-space position of glyph.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Desirable Components</h2>

<h2>History/done</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Build file needs javadoc target. [2004-07-12 cmg]<br>
  </li>
  <li>WebStart installation dataspace should be persistent (symptom:
restarting the dataspace loses all component requests and links).
[2004-07-12 cmg]<br>
  </li>
  <li>Container persistence of sub-component GUIDs for sub-components
and their properties (symptom: after restarting a persistence container
any links to/from sub-components are apparently missing (since they
link to/from the old property GUID)). [2004-07-13 cmg]<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Auto-export of capabilities from the container (present in
Webstart version already). [2004-07-12 cmg]<br>
  </li>
  <li>WebStart version should show [a little] current status of host,
and give
access to browser(s)/GUIs... [2004-07-12 cmg]</li>
  <li>Automatic coercion to target property type on set, e.g. link a
string property to an int property causing the target to parse the
string if it is a stringified number.[basically only for numbers, char,
boolean and toString - 2004-07-13 cmg]</li>
  <li>Some attempt to enhance synchronization to avoid
races/livelock/deadlock. Note: all property item changes will now be
asynchronous compared to the property change event that triggered them.
[2004-07-13 cmg]<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Save and restore configurations, i.e. back up dataspace,
per-container and per-component persistence information so that the
same arrangement of components can be restored at a later time.
Currently only the state of the system at the present time is
persistent (over partial or complete system failure). [doesn't do
anything about internal component persistence, but i think that is ok
2004-07-13 cmg]</li>
  <li>Component browser adding 'delayed' properties not working (at
least once) - delayed properties not shown in component tree
[2004-07-14 cmg]</li>
  <li>Added Set Value Popup to browser (context menu on Property node
in running component tree) [2004-07-14 cmg]</li>
  <li>Occasional deadlock (?) when accessing video processor embedded
web
server for image viewing or configuration (symptom: capture device
stops printing frame #s indicated stopped or stalled) [hopefully fixed
2004-07-14 cmg]<br>
  </li>
  <li>Deadlock is possible, e.g. video capture thread emits frame,
locking
capture component and chain of handler components, one of which emits a
property change event which requires the ContainerManager lock to
progress. Concurrently, a change on a linked (source) property changes,
acquires the ContainerManager lock (first), and then attempts to set
the target property on one of the locked components. Resolution:
property change event handler must be able to make progress (with
required sync. access to internal information about bean property
items) concurrently with in-progress property change and set.
[2004-07-14 cmg]</li>
  <li>Vision framework components (processor, average) stop correctly
[2004-07-14 cmg]</li>
  <li>Allow (user) naming of capabilities, components [in progress],
?links, e.g .using RDF statements with property dc:title shared
persistently in dataspace (needs support from browser(s) and config
manager) [2004-07-14 cmg]</li>
  <li>Vision framework capture components crash (JVM crash) if stopped
and restarted. This seems to be a JMF issue?! A messy workaround would
retain the internal stuff but just make the surface bean stuff go away.
[messy workaround done 2004-07-14 cmg]</li>
  <li>? Restarting a persistent container with a visionframework chain
does not always correctly set the destination sink value. (may be a
more general race condition with initial values) [possible fix;
awaiting confirmation/replication - 2004-07-13 cmg]</li>
  <li>Security needs implementing in webstart (shared secret)
[2004-07-15 cmg]</li>
  <li><span style="font-style: italic;"></span>WebStart access to
component updates site(s)/facilities with download of components, DLLs,
etc. [2004-07-15 cmg]</li>
  <li><span style="font-style: italic;"></span>WebStart handling a JAR
and DLL dependencies of components (load,
path)[2004-07-15 cmg]</li>
  <li><span style="font-style: italic;"></span>Webstart file cache
should remove old un-needed files.[2004-07-15 cmg]</li>
  <li><span style="font-style: italic;"></span>WebStart version
should show [more] current status of host, ...containers to be stopped
and restarted [2004-07-16 cmg]<br>
  </li>
  <li><span style="font-style: italic;"></span>Logging/console
output fixup - for diagnostics/debugging (to file?) [2004-07-15 cmg]<br>
  </li>
  <li><span style="font-style: italic;"></span>Add config manager to
webstart [2004-07-15 cmg]</li>
  <li><span style="font-style: italic;"></span>After joining a newly
discovered installation, then terminating it, the BootFrame still shows
it as discovered, not known. [2004-07-19 cmg]<br>
  </li>
  <li><span style="font-style: italic;"></span>If a webstart slave is
(auto)started without its master running the installation is started
but the container is not. This is no good: it should either stop
installation until discovered, or start container as well so that it
will (re)try connect to DS. [2004-07-19 cmg]</li>
  <li><span style="font-style: italic;"></span>Bean Shell Script
component should have a property that can be used to force it to
execute and also make it stop when it has gone into an infinite loop.
[2004-07-19 ted]</li>
  <li><span style="font-style: italic;"></span>At least once I used
configuration manager to clear and re-make a video processing network,
and the simple video processor did not recover its configuration. Not
sure if this indicates a more general problem. [fixed - persistence
startup update issue - 2004-07-19 cmg]<br>
  </li>
  <li><span style="font-style: italic;"></span>?Once terminated
installation (with component browser running - might be significant)
and the host manager did not reappear. [not seen this again for a while
- cmg]</li>
  <li><span style="font-style: italic;"></span>Add timeview (live
and logged) to webstart. [2004-07-19 cmg]</li>
  <li>Fix timeview time
stamps to be something useful (e.g. for
replaytool) [2004-07-19 cmg]<br>
  </li>
  <li><span style="font-style: italic;"></span>Timeview should show
given (RDF) names. [2004-07-19 cmg]</li>
  <li><span style="font-style: italic;"></span>Timeview should allow
property names to be specified (for output to log files) (perhaps using
RDF mechanism). [2004-07-19 cmg]</li>
  <li><span style="font-style: italic;"></span>Timeview should cope
with any height of tracks (currently fixed-size panel - tracks lost at
top). [2004-07-19 cmg]<br>
  </li>
  <li><span style="font-style: italic;"></span>Installation manager
"Dataspace [not] connected" does not change back from "...not..." to
"...connected" when master is restarted. (not async???) [2004-07-19 cmg]</li>
  <li>SmartITs factory components do not stop. [2004-07-20 cmg]<br>
  </li>
  <li>Video averager does not reflect change in threshold property in
(persisted) config property. [2004-07-20 cmg]<br>
  </li>
  <li> Java version of the Phidgets Manager and device and sensor/etc.
components comparable to the C# version using the Phidget Java binding
[NB input only, at present - waiting on support from Phidgets 2.0 input
- 2004-07-20 tom hart]</li>
  <li>Various component browser consistency and link view enhancements
[2004-07-20 cmg]</li>
  <li><span style="font-style: italic;"></span>We need an easy way to
build the webstart verion(s). [2004-07-20 sxi]</li>
  <li>...per-container persistence
does not atomically transition from one backup to another, i.e. there
is a period of time during the writing of persistence files in which a
container or host failure will leave an unreadable (typically
truncated, i.e. partially written) persistence file. [2004-07-20 sxi]</li>
  <li><span style="font-style: italic;"></span>Use property values
serialised in container persistence file to
initialise writable properties on non-Persistable components (this
would avoid the need to implement Persistable if a component exposes
all of its state as properties). [2004-07-21 cmg]</li>
  <li>Dynamo media viewer does not stop or re-start. [2004-07-21 cmg]</li>
  <li>Clean shutdown/restart option for containers; Webstart version
should allow containers a clean shutdown (on
stop container or installation), ... [2004-07-21 cmg]</li>
  <li>Dataspace persistence (a) should use write to temp and rename
strategy to avoid exposing incomplete checkpoint files (b) should catch
and log/ignore IO exceptions during reading of event log (which may be
truncated) [2004-07-26 cmg]</li>
  <li>Webstarted container
hangs&nbsp; on attempt to instantiate a
component class which requires (not exactly sure which) loading of a
native library and/or access to another jar file (which may do the
same), i.e. video capture, media viewer, phidgets. [2004-07-28 sxi]</li>
  <li><span style="font-style: italic;"></span>Container persistance
file path to component jar not always
matched by actual jar on restart (observed when i used webstart version
2004-07-21 ish, logged in as local admin). [presumed fixed 2004-07-23
cmg]</li>
  <li>Installation GUI: show status of download/update; add 'export
secret' GUI option (just display in text field for
now?!) [2004-07-30 cmg]</li>
  <li>Dynamo media viewer hangs on startup in webstart version (new
feature today :-( ). [2004-07-28 sxi]</li>
  <li>Audio capture and processing framework comparable to the video
framework, e.g. to detect noise level from a microphone. [2004-07-30
cmg]</li>
  <li>Bean supporting MIT's Processing language for display components.
[chris 2004-09-01]<br>
  </li>
  <li>Video plus audio, video-only and audio-only streaming and display
components to support media-server functionality, serving media from
files. Possible channel abstraction? Could use JMF RTP support. Option:
video framework transmitter component, e.g. for remote video
monitoring. [tom has done an initial version]<br>
  </li>
  <li>RFID Tag Readers (various) [ted TagIt&nbsp; 2004-09-01]<br>
  </li>
  <li>SMS Gateway [shahram 2004-09-05]<br>
