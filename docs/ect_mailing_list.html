<h3>Introduction</h3>

There are two mailing lists that you can subscribe
to if you are interested in ECT. These mailing lists
are hosted by 
<a href="http://www.sf.net" target="_blank">SourceForge</a>, 
and are also used by individual who are interested in
<a href="../../../equip4j/equip4jcore/docs/index.html" target="main">
EQUIP4J</a> section of this website. The mailing lists
that are available are:

<ul>
<li>the equip-users mailing list - intended for ECT or 
EQUIP4J users to post comments, requests for help, 
requests for features and bug reports, and as a mechanism
for announcements about software to be made
<li>the equip-developers mailing list - intended
to provide a forum for ECT or EQUIP4J developers to 
discuss issues relating to development
</ul>

Both of these lists are currently very low traffic
(~1 message a month).

<h3>Using the mailing lists</h3>

To subscribe to either mailing list, go to the
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/mail/?group_id=126969"
target="_blank">
EQUIP project mailing list page</a>, which is hosted
by SourceForge, and which also provides facilities to 
browse the mailing list archives, and to unsubscribe
and modify your mailing list preferences.
