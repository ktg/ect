EQUATOR/EQUIP Component Toolkit (ECT) Webstart.

See http://sourceforge.net/projects/equip

To run from a copy of the webstart directory using webstart (rather than the runWebstart.bat script) you must edit the "ect.jnlp" file and update the "codebase" and "download" properties to the full local file URL of the copy (for a local file-copy installation) or the public HTTP URL of the copy (for a remotely accessibly http-based version).
